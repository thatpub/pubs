This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Added more
responsibilities to the Housing Flight and generally updated outdated verbiage and realigned the

   ensuring assigned living quarters are kept neat, clean, and in safe condition. Dormitories will
   be monitored by the 3rd Support Group Commander (3 SPTG/CC), unit/group commanders,
   squadron section commanders, first sergeants, and dormitory managers to ensure minimum
   standards are met.

    1.2. Recreational equipment in common-use areas is to be used only by assigned residents
    and their guests, who will keep the common areas clean. Only bona fide dormitory residents

    implements local operating rules for unaccompanied housing.
    2.3. Unit commanders will review hardship requests to move off base, receive monetary
    allowances, and make recommendations to the Housing Flight for approval/disapproval.
    Disapproval rests solely with 3 CES/CC. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring
    dormitory inspections are completed on a recurring basis in their affected dormitories. The
    frequency and procedures for dormitory inspections will be determined by each group

    closely with the dormitory manager to maintain good order and discipline. The 3 LSS, 3
    MSS, 3 OSS, 3 CES, 3 MDG, and 381 IS first sergeants have direct supervision over their
    group’s assigned dormitory manager.
    2.7. The noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) of the dormitory managers will be the

    commanders. The NCOIC provides monthly occupancy reports to the Housing Flight for the
    AF Form 2085, Unaccompanied Personnel Housing Inventory and Utilization Data, report to
    PACAF. The NCOIC provides an inventory of dormitory furnishings, appliances, and
    equipment to the Housing Flight Manager as of 30 September annually. The NCOIC also
    provides agenda items to the Housing Flight Manager for the QLIC. The rater of the NCOIC
    is the 3 CES First Sergeant.
    2.8. Dormitory managers will supervise members detailed to bay orderly duties; serve as
    focal point for maintenance requirements with the 3 CES; report occupancy data to the
