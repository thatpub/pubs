1. Definition - Air Force Network Operating Instructions (AFNOI). These are directive specialized
publications as prescribed in AFI 33-360, Volume 1, Publications Management Program. Network Man-
agers will ensure they are used in day-to-day operations to operate and maintain network software and
equipment. AFNOIs provide specific procedures and checklists on how to operate or maintain Air Force
network components and respond to events. AFNOIs are used to document standard operating procedures
as currently defined in special instruction to communicators (SPIN-C) documents. AFNOIs are directly
tied to career field job qualification standards as the training reference for all systems that do not have a

3. General.
   3.1. Introduction. AFNOIs are directive specialized publications providing operating procedures and
   checklists for network operations. AFNOIs are used to document standard processes as well as oper-
   ate, maintain, or troubleshoot network software and equipment and are generated for technical sub-
   jects not covered by Air Force publications or technical orders. All AFNOIs are specifically linked to
   one or more of the Network Operations AFSC’s Job Qualification Standards (JQS) as the training ref-
   erence. Network Managers must ensure their use in day-to-day operations.
   3.2. Process.
      3.2.1. AFNOIs are developed and processed one of two ways.
          3.2.1.1. HQ AFCA/GCLO will develop new and revised AFNOIs as technical, operational,
          and training demands require. HQ AFCA/GCLO will utilize NCC/NOSC/AFNOSC opera-
          tional expertise to help develop AFNOIs.
          3.2.1.2. MAJCOMs/agencies help develop new and revised AFNOIs. MAJCOMs will coordi-
          nate intent to develop an AFNOI with AFCA to help eliminate duplication of effort. NCCs for-
          ward AFNOI proposals through their respective MAJCOM OPR.
      3.2.2. Local AFNOIs. The Officer in Charge (OIC)/Noncommissioned Officer in Charge
      (NCOIC) of any NCC/NOSC/AFNOSC may authorize development and use of local Network
      Operating Instructions (NOI). These local NOIs may be in the form of supplements to AFNOIs or
      may be unique to the MAJCOM/NCC. Local NOIs (whether at base, MAJCOM, or AFNOSC)
      will be forwarded through the respective MAJCOM or Headquarters-level for consideration as an
      Air Force-level AFNOI. The requirement to accomplish local AFNOIs must be documented in a
      local JQS or AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS.
          3.2.2.1. Local NCC/NOSC may supplement Air Force or MAJCOM NOIs as local require-
          ments dictate. When supplementing AFNOIs, only subparagraphs may be added. Do not
          change or renumber main paragraph headings. This will maintain standard steps throughout
          the Air Force.
          3.2.2.2. MAJCOM/NCC may develop local NOIs that are unique to their organization or
          Command. Do not create local NOIs for which there is already an AFNOI. In most cases, local
          NOIs are created for MAJCOM-unique systems that are not used Air Force-wide.
          3.2.2.3. Local NOI procedures:
              3.2.2.3.1. Conspicuously mark or label the NOI as local use only.
              3.2.2.3.2. Number local NOIs using the system in paragraph 3.3.
4                                                                       AFI33-115V3 15 APRIL 2004


              3.2.2.3.3. Rescind local NOIs after an Air Force or MAJCOM NOI is published on the
              same subject.
           3.2.2.4. Local NOIs cannot contradict an AFNOI or MAJCOM NOI. Changes can restrict
           requirements but not override or negate them.
           3.2.2.5. The Air Force OPTN web page referenced in paragraph 2.2.3. provides guidance on
           format and content of local NOIs. An AFNOI template can be downloaded from the web page
           and used as a guide for developing local NOIs.
           3.2.2.6. Maintain and dispose of local NOIs according to procedures in AFI 33-360, Volume
           1, AFMAN 37-123, and Air Force WEB-RIMS RDS located at
           https://webrims.amc.af.mil/rds/index.cfm for NOI publication record sets.
       3.2.3. Proposed AFNOIs. MAJCOMs will evaluate and field-test proposed AFNOIs before for-
       warding them to HQ AFCA/GCLO, 203 W. Losey St, Room 3100, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222,
       email: mailto:afca.gclo@scott.af.mil.
       3.2.4. Changes to AFNOIs. Forward changes (except for minor punctuation and spelling errors)
       as AFNOI revisions. To revise an AFNOI, the completed AFNOI is reaccomplished and processed
       in the same manner as new AFNOIs. Submit recommended changes, additions, or deletions
       through the MAJCOM channels (MAJCOM AFNOI OPR) to HQ AFCA/GCLO.
       3.2.5. Implementation. Implement AFNOIs upon notification unless otherwise specified.
       3.2.6. Approval Process. Prior to certification, each AFNOI will go through a thorough review
       process.
           3.2.6.1. Initial review will be an internal AFCA review.
           3.2.6.2. Following AFCA internal coordination, AFNOIs will be sent out to all MAJCOM
           AFNOI POCs as well as the AFNOSC for review. MAJCOM POCs are expected to coordinate
           with the appropriate offices or personnel to ensure an accurate analysis is done. For example,
           if the AFNOI covers network outage reporting, then the NOSC crew should be involved in the
           analysis. MAJCOMs and the AFNOSC will be given 30 days for review and coordination on
           AFNOIs.
           3.2.6.3. Once all coordination is complete, HQ AFCA/GCL will certify and HQ AFCA/GC
           will approve the AFNOI.
       3.2.7. Notification. Notification of new or revised AFNOIs will take place via C4 NOTAM. HQ
       AFCA/GCLO will notify the AFNOSC, as described in AFI 33-115 Volume 1, Network Manage-
       ment (will become Network Operations), that a new AFNOI is available for download and use.
       The AFNOSC will then generate a Directive C4 NOTAM to each MAJCOM announcing the new
       AFNOI and directing units to download and use the new document.
       3.2.8. Rescission of AFNOIs. AFNOIs are rescinded when no longer pertinent. Notify HQ
       AFCA/GCLO, through command channels, on an AF Form 1382, when an AFNOI should be
       rescinded.
    3.3. Numbering and Indexing. AFNOIs are broken down into 9 series and 4 subseries.
       3.3.1. Functional area series numbering:
