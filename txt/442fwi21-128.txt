SUMMARYOF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This document
clarifies Lightning Watch and Lightning Warning verbiage, standardizes nautical units and
definitions.

1. Procedures and Responsibilities:
 2                                                            442FWI21-128 21 AUGUST 2013


     1.1. When a severe weather warning or watch is received from the current base weather
     system, provided by the 509th Operations Support Squadron (OSS)/ Operations Support
     Weather (OSW), the 442d MXG Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will implement
     Severe Weather Checksheet Number 31. The production superintendent will coordinate with
     the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and Munitions Control to ensure actions are taken to make
     aircraft ground handling as safe as possible.
     1.2. The production supervisor will determine what maintenance is essential for the safety of
     personnel and protection of aircraft and equipment. He, or she, will coordinate with the 303d
     Fighter Squadron (FS) SOF to cross-check weather data and consult on necessary actions.
     1.3. The 303 FS SOF will be the primary interface with the Whiteman Air Force Base
     (WAFB) weather flight and through coordination with production superintendent via MOC,
     be the primary decision-making authority for required actions based on all weather data,
     forecasts, observations, watches and warnings. MOC will monitor Joint Environmental
     Toolkit (JET) to ensure they get weather warnings as soon as they are issued. If the 303 FS
     SOF cannot be reached or decision making time is critical, the production
     superintendent/night shift supervisor will take appropriate action IAW this instruction to
     safeguard 442 FW personnel and assets. MOC will coordinate with base weather only when
     SOF is not on duty.
     1.4. If weather conditions dictate hangaring of aircraft in excess of 442d hangar capacities,
     the production superintendent, via 442d MOC, will request emergency use of 509th facilities,
     through 509th MOC.
2. Weather General.
     2.1. WAFB weather forecasts, watches and warnings are produced by two weather sources,
     the 509 OSS/OSW and the 26th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS), Barksdale Air Force
     Base (AFB), which is the hub that services the eastern United States. The 509 OSS/OSW is
     the sole source of weather observations at WAFB and will be considered as the singular
     official source for real-time weather data.
        2.2.1. The following terms and definitions can be referenced in WAFBI 15-11, Base
        Weather Support Plan, and are pertinent to the applications of this instruction and
        weather based decisions: Observation, Forecast, Watch and Warning. They are
        paraphrased as follows:
            2.2.1.1. Observation: Current weather conditions actually occurring at or near the
            airfield. Observations are taken at regular intervals or out of cycle when changing
            weather conditions warrant. Current observation reports include ceiling, visibility,
            precipitation, thunderstorms, lightning, winds, etc. The local observation is produced
            by the 509 OSS/OSW.
            2.2.1.2. Forecast: Predicted weather conditions for a specified time in the future
            based on current conditions, observations at other stations, weather instrumentation
            and charts, and weather models. Forecasts are produced for WAFB by the 26 OWS,
            Barksdale AFB, but can be modified by the 509 OSS/OSW via their own locally
            produced forecast.
442FWI21-128 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                   3


         2.2.1.3. Watch: A weather watch is a special notice provided to support customers
         that alerts them of a potential for weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a
         hazard to life or property for which the customer must take protective action.
         Whenever meteorological conditions are favorable or forecast to be favorable for
         such conditions to develop, the 26 OWS will issue a weather watch, for WAFB, valid
         for a given time period. Personnel should refrain from calling 509 OSS/OSW unless
         it is absolutely necessary. The text of the weather watch will contain all essential
         information. Watches are issued to alert organizations to the potential for occurrence
         of certain elements for planning/preparation purposes. Weather Watches may not
         always result in Advisories or Warnings.
         2.2.1.4. Warning: A weather warning is a special notice provided to supported
         customers that alerts them to weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard
         to life or property. The 26 OWS and 509 OSS/OSW issue weather warnings,
         upgrades/downgrades, extensions and cancellations for a five nm radius of the
         runway midpoint (unless otherwise stated in the text of the warning e.g. observed
         lightning within 10 nm).
      2.2.2. Watches and Warnings are produced by both 509 OSS/OSW and 26 OWS,
      Barksdale’s weather flight.
      2.2.3. It is critical that the 303 FS SOF and the 442d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron
      (AMXS) production superintendent have a clear knowledge of the meaning of all the
      aforementioned weather terminology and understand the difference between watches,
      warnings, forecasts and observations. The 303 FS SOF will decide on the appropriate
      course of action when weather conditions and predictions fall within the margins of clear
      guidance provided below. If the 303 FS SOF cannot be reached or decision making time
      is critical, the production superintendent/night shift supervisor will take appropriate
      action IAW this instruction to safeguard 442 FW personnel and assets.
3. General Lightning:
   3.1. The following procedures will be implemented when WAFB issues lightning Advisories
   Watches or Warnings:
      3.1.1. Lightning Advisory within 25 nautical miles: 303 FS SOF will continue to
      monitor weather and advise the Production Superintendent of any planned actions. 442
      MOC will inform all agencies that lightning has been observed within 25 nautical miles.
      3.1.2. Lightning Watch: A Lightning Watch will be issued approximately 30 minutes
      prior to lightning within five nautical miles. 442 MOC will inform all agencies that a
      Lightning Watch has been issued, indicating the potential exists for lightning within five
      nautical miles. During a Lightning Watch, operations or activities may continue.
      However, all personnel must be prepared to implement Lightning Warning procedures
      without delay. Personnel engaged in explosives operations at outdoor locations will
      initiate controlled termination procedures IAW MOI 91-204, MUNITIONS HANDLING
      PROCEDURES DURING SEVERE WEATHER/ELECTRICAL AND / OR
      THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS.
      3.1.3. Lightning Warnings:
 4                                                            442FWI21-128 21 AUGUST 2013


            3.1.3.1. Lightning within 10 nm (Observed): 303 FS SOF approves aircraft launch
            and recovery based on weather situation and will coordinate with the Production
            Superintendent. The Production Superintendent will determine what essential
            maintenance continues and will prioritize maintenance actions if lightning within 5
            nm is imminent. Fuel cell maintenance, Egress maintenance and flight line explosive
            loading operations will terminate.
            3.1.3.2. Lightning within 5 nm (Observed): 442 MOC will inform all agencies that a
            Lightning Warning has been issued for observed lightning within 5 nm. All outdoor
            operations will cease and personnel will seek shelter.
4. Tornado or High Winds:
     4.1. If local winds in excess of 30 knots are reported at WAFB, fuel cell maintenance on the
     flight-line will be terminated.
     4.2. If forecasted winds are expected to exceed 40 knots, the aircraft will be moored to the
     ground. Remove all maintenance stands and loose equipment from parking apron and
     secure. If space and time permit, place non-powered support equipment inside hangars and
     docks. Remove fire extinguishers not in use and park on the edge of ramp. Support
     equipment outdoors will be secured.
     4.3. If winds exceed 55 knots aircraft will be hangared. Implement procedures in paragraph
     1.3 if necessary.
5. Wet Bulb Temperatures: As a general rule, when the wet bulb temperature reaches 94
degrees, maintenance will be curtailed to mission essential requirements. Outside work
requirements must be evaluated by the applicable maintenance supervision from the 442 MXG to
determine mission essential requirements. Detailed guidance is found in WAFBI 48-103, Heat
and Cold Stress Guidance.
6. Wind Chill: As a general rule, when the equivalent chill temperature is –25 degrees
Fahrenheit, the outside work requirements must be evaluated by the applicable maintenance
supervision from the 442 MXG to determine mission-essential requirements. Detailed guidance
is found in WAFBI 48-103, Heat and Cold Stress Guidance.
7. Hail, Snow and/or Freezing Precipitation:
     7.1. When 1/2 inch hail or larger is forecasted, the aircraft will be sheltered, or hangared.
     The production superintendent or night-shift supervisor will make the decision to hangar the
     aircraft when snow or freezing precipitation is forecasted.
     7.2. The production superintendent or night-shift supervisor will determine when snow
     and/or ice covered aircraft parking ramps are suitable for aircraft maintenance operations.
     The scope of maintenance will be limited until the aircraft parking ramp has been cleared or
     treated for ice and snow removal.
8. Non-Duty Hours:
     8.1. In the event of a weather warning during non-duty hours, the squadron superintendents
     will be notified. If required, the squadron superintendents will form a severe weather team
     consisting of a maintenance supervisor and six mechanics. The superintendents will ensure
442FWI21-128 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                  5


  the right combination of personnel with the applicable qualifications are assembled to handle
  any requirements associated with the severe weather.
  8.2. All maintenance personnel will be subject to recall if it becomes necessary to evacuate
  aircraft. After determining workload requirements, flight chiefs will recall personnel from
  leave as necessary and recommend priority of evacuation. 442 AMXS personnel will be
  responsible for enroute maintenance team with tools and equipment, if required.
