This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all WC-135C/W ACC units. This addendum does not apply to Air National Guard
or Air Force Reserve Command units and members. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with (IAW) Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS). Contact supporting records managers as required. Send recommended changes or

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Mission columns
have been changed. Numerous systems Work Unit Codes (WUCs) have been added or deleted.
Remarks are incorporated for each applicable WUC and have replaced notes to better clarify
mission capability requirements.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and
subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. MESLs are not comprehensive WUC lists and are not intended
to mirror Minimum Equipment Lists. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable
(MC) aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC
OMNIBUS Plan.
1.1. Remarks are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded mission
systems.
1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A
Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be
configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit's
requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
1.4. Reading the MESL (Table 1). A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC
against the Full System List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems Lists (BSLs) across the
page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of
BSL columns. The aircraft MESL incorporates all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is
important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's
assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and
report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF
(training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TNG columns
, and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL
and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the
MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
