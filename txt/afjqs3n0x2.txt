DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE                                          Air Force Job Qualification
Headquarters, US Air Force                                                     Standard 3N0X2
Washington DC 20330-5020                                                         01 March 2009

Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS)

SECTION A: GENERAL

1. This Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS) standardizes on-the-job training for
Airmen assigned to broadcast operations positions within the Armed Forces Radio and
Television Service (AFRTS). This document identifies the majority of duties and tasks required
to attain qualification. Use this document to plan and record all duty-position related training,
and as a basis for preparing a Master Task Listing (MTL) for each functional area. The AFJQS is
used by unit training managers, supervisors, trainers, trainees, and other training functions to
plan, conduct, and document OJT.
2. Personnel assigned to AFRTS duty positions are trained and qualified to the GO/NO GO
level. Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local
requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. AF job qualification
standards pertain to all organizations that support AFRTS unit task codes (UTCs).
3. Maintain this AFJQS according to AFI 36-2201, volumes 1-6, and AFI 36-2233. Urgent
changes are disseminated via message. Enter additional local tasks in the blank areas on the
AFJQS or add forms. Submit recommended AFJQS improvements or corrections to SAF/PARF.
4. Review AF e-Publishing, the official source site for Air Force administrative publications and
forms (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/), to identify available training materials. Use this AFJQS
in conjunction with other applicable JQSs or the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP) and locally assigned tasks to identify work center duty positions. Also, use this AFJQS
along with other applicable JQSs and the CFETP to evaluate newly assigned personnel and
identify individual training requirements.
5. Tasks listed on the AFJQS were selected according to the Instructional System Development
(ISD) process and are the minimum, mandatory AF training requirements. The “X” code in the
Core Task column of the AF Form 797 indicates the individual must be trained and certified on
that particular task. The “X*” code identifies tasks that may not be common to all equipment or
functions; however, the task must be trained if it is assigned to the individual’s duty position.
The “—” code indicates training on this task is a local determination while ensuring 100 percent
task coverage within the work center. Trainees must accurately perform each assigned task
unassisted according to training references (TR) before being certified.
SECTION B: DOCUMENTATION

1. AFJQS/CFETP tasks are compiled in an automated training management system, such as the
Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) Training Business Area (TBA) if available. The
system must contain each AFJQS/CFETP title line with appropriate AFJQS/CFETP numbers,
titles, and dates. Listed below are AFJQS/CFETP and automated documentation requirements.
The alphanumeric AFJQS number is converted to a decimal number for use in IMDS TBA.
Alphanumeric numbers were converted by retaining the 200-series number and changing the
alpha character to the corresponding number, for instance, -200B becomes -200.2 and -201LB
becomes -201.12.2.
a. Load applicable tasks in the automated training system or identify training requirements by
circling the task numbers on each individual's AFJQS/CFETP.

b. If task statements contain more than one noun or action verb that precludes certification on the
entire task, load/circle the noun or verb to indicate the individual is being trained only on that
portion of the task.

c. When training is started on a task, enter the start date in the appropriate place. When training
is complete, document training and task certification according to local certification procedures.

2. Use the identification blocks below when the trainer is other than the trainee's immediate
supervisor.
