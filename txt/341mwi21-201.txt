       1.5.2. Monitor aircraft maintenance/operation areas to ensure a FOD free area. Secure
       FOD containers to vehicles that are normally operating in any aircraft maintenance/
       operation area in a manner that does not modify or damage rental or government leased
       vehicles and prevents the container from tipping over while the vehicle is in motion.
       Vehicle FOD containers may be locally manufactured and secured using bungee cord or
       similar material. Containers will not be obscured from view.

       /mooring points in the eight helicopter parking spot circles.
       1.5.5. All maintenance personnel working in aircraft maintenance/operation areas or
       hanger floors will perform FOD walks or checks in their respective areas a minimum of
       once per day. These dock areas are subject to spot inspections by all monitoring agencies
       and levels of supervision.
       1.5.6. All loose hardware will be contained in cloth screw bags or other suitable
       container that can be closed and secured to the removed item to prevent them from
       becoming FOD hazards.

       maintenance/operations and the job sight supervisor.
       1.5.8. Engine, aircraft, and pitot tube covers (if applicable) will be removed no earlier
       than 2 hours prior to crew show and installed upon completion of the BPO, no later than
       1hour after engine shut down or completion of spare duty for that day. High wind
       conditions will be considered for more stringent needs.
2. Prior to any helicopter engine operation, personnel will ensure the following:
   2.1. Tools, equipment and hardware have been accounted for and secured.
   2.2. A FOD Inspection of engine inlets, all decks and accessible compartments prior to
   engine operation is signed off in the helicopter 781A forms.
3. Flightline Clothing
   3.1. Metal insignias/badges will not be worn on the flightline.
   3.2. Wigs, hairpieces, metal hair fasteners, earrings, or any other jewelry that may fall off

     3.3. Loose fitting clothing or other apparel that may be caught in on the aircraft should not
     be worn. Climate and safety will be considered.
     3.4. Escorts of visiting personnel will ensure FOD prevention measures are taken.
4. Incident and mishap investigation:
     4.1. The wing FOD program manager will be notified of all Dropped Objects (DOP) and
     suspected/confirmed engine FOD damage. The wing FOD monitor will track, report and
     investigate all foreign objects and dropped objects to completion and provide synopsis of
     each event to the 341 MW/CV and 341 MXG/CC.
5. DOP
     5.1. Dropped Object (DO). A dropped object is any item that falls from an aircraft after
     engine start and before engine shutdown. For the purpose of this instruction, a secondary
     structure refers to any door, panel, cover, or cowling designed to be removed from the
     aircraft for maintenance purposes. Items that are dropped for mission requirements, such as
     Landing Zone Markers, are not considered DOs and are not reportable as such.
     5.2. Preventable Dropped Object. Any item lost due to negligence during inspection or
     installation.
6. General
     6.1. The prevention of in-flight loss of aircraft panels, parts, access doors, and other objects
     is the goal of DOP Program. All maintenance personnel must be aware of the potential for
     dropped objects. Supervisors must ensure the proper installation of panels and doors,
     and the quality of maintenance performed on structural components. All passengers will
     receive a briefing from the pilot or flight engineer and if an item is lost during flight the
     passenger should notify the flight engineer.
     6.2. Dropped Object Prevention is the responsibility of all aircraft operators and maintainers.
     Prevention begins when aircraft panels are removed, access doors opened, or when
     maintenance is performed on an exterior component. All personnel working in, on, and
     around aircraft must comply with the requirements of this instruction.
7. Procedures for removal, installation, and opening and closing documentation:
     7.1. Individuals tasked to remove external panels, fairings, engine cowling, antennas,
     windshields, and external light assemblies will enter a Red X in the aircraft forms prior to
     starting the removal/opening action.
     7.2. The Red X will not be signed off in the forms until the panel, fairing, engine cowling,
     antenna, windshield, or light assembly/subassembly is properly installed/closed and
     inspected.
     7.3. Whenever feasible, the individual tasked to perform the removal/installation or
     opening/closing action will remain assigned to the task until the action is completed and
     properly documented.
     7.4. When installing aircraft panels, doors, and components, place special emphasis on the
     condition of latches, fasteners, hinge pins, and hinge lobes. Ensure panels, doors, and
341MWI21-201 24 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                               5


   components fit properly and are attached securely, greatly reducing the chances for dropped
   objects.
8. Dropped Object Prevention Inspection (Panel Inspection)
   8.1. A panel inspection is required prior to every aircraft departure.
   8.2. An inspector for these purposes will be a qualified technician or lead.
   8.3. An inspector will inspect all engine and airframe panel security and streamlining.
   Aircraft forms will be reviewed and special attention paid to those areas where maintenance
   was performed.
9. Dropped Object Incident Notification
   9.1. Anyone suspecting a dropped object will immediately notify the appropriate shift lead,
   HMOC, QC/QA Inspector, Site Manager or as indicated on the Dropped Object Reporting
   Checklist, Attachment 3.
   9.2. Within 24 hours of the occurrence, the Dropped Object Officer/Monitor will report any
   dropped object to HQ AFGSC/A4MM and HQ 20AF/A4H via telephone, FAX, or e-mail.
10. Dropped Object Incident Investigation
   10.1. Each dropped object incident will be thoroughly investigated as soon as the loss is
   discovered.
   10.2. All efforts will be made to determine the exact cause of the dropped object so proper
   corrective action may be taken to prevent reoccurrence.
   10.3. The shift lead will ensure the aircraft forms are reviewed to verify the item is a
   dropped object and was not removed by maintenance personnel.
Note: No maintenance of any type will be accomplished in the dropped object area until the
appropriate activities as required by individual site host bases perform an investigation.
11. Material Deficiency
   11.1. If a material deficiency caused the dropped object, submit a Material Deficiency
   Report (Deficiency Report), IAW Tech Order 00-35D-54, USAF Material Deficiency
   Reporting and Investigating System.
12. Dropped Object Incident Reporting
   12.1. The Dropped Object Officer/Monitor will submit a formal report to HQ
   AFGSC/A4MM and HQ 20AF/A4H within three duty days and will contain as a minimum
   the information indicated in Attachment 2.
