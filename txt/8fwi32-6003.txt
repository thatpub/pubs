     1.8. Resolves disputes or complaints between UH residents and domestic employees.
        1.8.1. Residents and domestic employees should initially attempt to resolve disputes. If
        disputes cannot be resolved, and the Airmen Dorm Leader (ADL) cannot resolve the
        issue, 8 CES/CEAC will become involved.
        1.8.2. If the involved parties cannot agree on a satisfactory solution, either party may
        elect to terminate services. The resident then has the option to obtain service from a
        different domestic employee, if available.
8FWI32-6003 14 DECEMBER 2011                                                                    3


   1.9. Ensures no more domestic employees are hired in UH than necessary. Normally, the
   number of people served by one employee is six to eight dormitory residents or one
   employee for four Gunsmoke Hill residents.
   1.10. Assists employees in bi-weekly collection of fees, when necessary.
   1.11. Selects, supervises, counsels, and terminates employment of domestic employees who
   work in UH.
   1.12. 8 CES/CEAC will complete required paperwork to initiate the investigation on
   prospective domestic employees. 8th Security Forces Squadron, Pass & ID (8 SFS/SFAP)
   will issue the domestic employee a temporary base pass (one year) and will notify 8
   CES/CEAC when the investigation is complete. The employee cannot work on the base until
   this pass has been issued.
2. Procedures:
   2.1. Upon request from a unit ADL or first sergeant, 8 CES/CEAC provides names of
   domestic employees from the waiting list. Domestic employees are only hired from the
   applicants on the waiting list maintained by 8 CES/CEAC.
   2.2. After a selection has been made, 8 CES/CEAC processes the employee for a temporary
   base pass and a background check, as applicable, through 8 SFS/SFAP.
   2.3. Revocation of Contractor Authorization
      2.3.1. Immediate termination of contractor authorization results when domestic
      employees are involved in any activity such as theft, drinking on the job, threats of bodily
      harm, or other similar serious acts. Acts of this nature do not require any further
      justification for removal.
      2.3.2. Domestic employee contractor authorization will not be involuntarily revoked
      because of their age. If their physical abilities prevent them from performing their duties
      and they are unable to make alternative arrangements to have the work performed, they
      will be given a two-week notice that their contractor authorization will be canceled.
      2.3.3. 8 CES/CEAC is responsible for ensuring the revoked employee completes base
      clearance. This includes ensuring the employee has been paid in full, turning in their
      base pass, turning in hand receipt items, and escorting the employee off base.
   2.4. Domestic Employee Underperformance:
      2.4.1. The objective is to correct underperformance, not to punish or penalize.
      Progressive measures are applied in an effort to rehabilitate employees before revoking
      contractor authorization. Suspension and removal of contractor authorization results only
      when evidence warrants such action.
          2.4.1.1. When noncompliance occurs, the first step to correct the domestic employee
          is for the resident receiving service to discuss the issues with the employee. 8
          CES/CEAC highly recommends that residents do not withhold wages.                  If
          performance does not improve, the resident has the option of terminating service.
          The resident should report this to the ADL or 8 CES/CEAC.
 4                                                           8FWI32-6003 14 DECEMBER 2011


            2.4.1.2. In order to correct noncompliance, after four verified complaints in a one
            year period the domestic employee will have contractor authorization suspended for a
            two-week period. If there are additional complaints, the domestic employee will have
            contractor authorization status revoked. 8 CES/CEAC will coordinate with the 8th
            Fighter Wing, Legal Office (8 FW/JA) before revoking contractor status of any
            domestic employee.
3. Hours of Work, Duties, and Responsibilities:
     3.1. The regular duty schedule for all domestic employees is Monday through Friday, no
     earlier than 0700 to no later than 1700; the actual hours will depend on dormitory residents’
     work schedules. Saturday service may be negotiated between the resident and employee, if
     desired, at an additional cost to the recommended wages.
     3.2. Domestic employees perform duties such as cleaning rooms and bathrooms, changing
     linen, emptying waste baskets, sweeping, vacuuming, dusting, mopping floors, cleaning
     kitchen facilities, polishing shoes, etc. They do laundry, including washing, starching, and
     ironing of both military and civilian clothing. They are responsible for the security of private
     property while on duty, and ensuring all doors are locked when rooms are not being cleaned
     or when leaving the premises.
     3.3. Domestic employees will use sound utilities conservation practices. Specifically:
        3.3.1. Use only those lights necessary to perform work.
        3.3.2. Do not use dormitory showers, washers, and dryers for personal needs.
        3.3.3. Ensure washers and dryers are operated properly and not overloaded.
        3.3.4. Keep interior fire doors closed.
        3.3.5. Keep laundry room doors closed when washers and dryers are in operation.
        3.3.6. Keep external doors closed, in order to keep insects out and temperature regulated.
     3.4. Domestic employees will comply with trash enclosure procedures:
        3.4.1. All trash must be bagged, sealed, and placed in proper containers inside trash
        enclosures.
        3.4.2. For enclosures equipped with doors, keep doors closed at all times.
        3.4.3. Do not stack trash cans so they are visible above the enclosure walls.
        3.4.4. Do not dispose of scrap of wood, scrap metal, furniture, appliances, or hazardous
        waste in or around the enclosure.
     3.5. To ensure washers and dryers are available to those residents who decline service,
     domestic employees will be authorized to use only a portion of those appliances. Unit ADLs
     and designated representatives, or 8 CES/CEAC, will designate specific washers and dryers
     for military member use only. Care must be taken to ensure domestic employees have the
     means to perform their jobs while residents’ rights to use the machines are protected.
     3.6. Domestic employees will only use washers and dryers for their paying customers’
     laundry. Domestic employees may use a maximum of two washers and dryers to clean
     residents’ clothing.
8FWI32-6003 14 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  5


   3.7. Domestic employees will not care for children while on duty.
4. Pay Administration:
   4.1. 8 CES/CEAC will obtain the pay information for Korean National employees from the
   8th Force Support Squadron, Civilian Personnel Section (8 FSS/FSMC) and use the pay
   information when recommending a minimum wage scale for domestic employees. The 8th
   Mission Support Group Commander (8 MSG/CC) must approve changes to the wage scale
   for domestic employees.
   4.2. Final wage determination is negotiated between the resident and domestic employee. If
   the wage offered is not acceptable to the domestic employee, he or she may choose not to
   provide service.
   4.3. Residents must pay the domestic employee in advance on the first and fifteenth of each
   month. 8 FW IMT 17EK, must be signed by both the resident and domestic employee each
   pay period. A payment in Base Exchange or commissary merchandise is prohibited.
   Personnel making or receiving such payments are subject to disciplinary action. Severance
   pay will not be paid to domestic employees because of the nature of employment and
   frequent change of residents.
5. Leave Administration:
   5.1. There is no leave for domestic employees. Time off is at the discretion of the resident.
   Residents should recognize Korean holidays, which involve family related observances and

   for nonwork time as a result of time off granted for short periods of illness or when the
   resident is temporarily absent. Payment of wages will normally not be made for resident

9. Optional Payments:
     9.1. Traditionally, Koreans receive a Christmas bonus form the occupants they work for.
     The bonus is usually equivalent to one pay period’s wages. This is over and above benefits
     and courtesies extended during the Christmas and New Year holiday season. Although
     payment of a bonus is not mandatory, it is a method of starting the New Year off with a good
     domestic employee/occupant relationship. If the occupant chooses to do so, it may be based
     on the working relationship between the occupant and domestic employee and the quality of
     service received. A bonus is a gift, not an inducement for better service.
     9.2. No person or organization represents domestic employees or solicits on their behalf.
     Any other correspondences occupants may receive from any other source concerning
     domestic employee bonuses are unofficial and not authorized by Kunsan AB authorities.
