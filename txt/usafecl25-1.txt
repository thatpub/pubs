                                                                                            Pages: 5

This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 25-1, War Reserve Materiel, 8 Nov
2004. This unit compliance inspection (UCI) checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector
General Activities, 22 Nov 2004 and the USAFE Supplement 1, 1 Jan 2005 inspection programs. This
checklist identifies compliance items that support guidance in the following: law, executive order, higher
headquarters (HHQ) publication (Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force Instruction (AFI), Air Force
Manual (AFMAN), etc.) and United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) publications. It applies to all
USAFE Logistics Readiness Squadrons (LRS) and geographically separated units (GSU) as indicated in
paragraph 2. It does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG)
units. This checklist supports guidance in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Material (WRM) Program Guidance
and Procedures, as well as the associated USAFE supplement. This checklist is intended for inspection
use. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication on AF Form 847, Recommendation
for Change of Publication, to USAFE Logistics Directorate, Logistics Readiness Division (HQ USAFE/
A4R), Unit 3050 Box 105, APO AE 09094. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes pre-
scribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-123 (will
convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, 31 Aug 1994 and disposed of in accordance with
the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.


1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or assessment.
As a minimum, units should use UCI’s in conjunction with the unit self-assessment. The objective is to
identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. HHQs may use this checklist in
whole or in part during visits or exercises.
   1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identified by
   functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General (HQ
   USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
2                                                                   USAFECL25-1 1 SEPTEMBER 2006


       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where noncom-
       pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect 62 system reli-
       ability. These requirements may be mandated by law, executive order, DoD directive, safety or
       Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as significant guide items requiring
       direct IG evaluation. CCGIs are identified by using uppercase and bold letters.
       1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall perfor-
       mance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance
       but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. CGIs are identified by using
       standard sentence case.

2. Applicability. All items in this checklist are assigned an applicability code designating the wing/unit/
installation to which the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following USAFE main oper-
ating bases (MOB): Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, Lajes, and Spangdahlem.
Applicability code 7 designates all GSUs with Logistics Readiness functions (Supply, Transportation,
Logistics Readiness Planning and Policy).

3. Forms Adopted. Refer to the listed prescribing directive (PD) for guidance on the completion of the
form. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, PD: AFI 11-215, USAFE Flight Man-
uals Program (FMP), 6 Apr 2006.
