SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The content of
AFI 47-101 has been significantly reduced and tiered to identify waiver authority for unit level
compliance items.        Content that outlines specific organizational and administrative
responsibilities of Dental Corps leadership has been removed. Specific details regarding clinical
patient management, management of AF dental clinics, Air Force Reserve Component
information and other attachments are now included in the current Dental Management Guide,
Clinical Practice Guidelines and/or the AFRC Dental Consolidated Policy Memorandum for
patient management.
1. Roles and Responsibilities. The Chief of Dental Services (CDS) shall ensure compliance
with all aspects of this AFI.
2. Scope of Care. The CDS will ensure comprehensive dental services are readily available and
delivered with maximum efficiency for all patients authorized dental benefits. (T-0) Dental
services consist of diagnostic, preventive, and corrective treatments and procedures necessary to
maintain and/or restore health and function of the teeth, periodontium, and other related
structures in the area of the oral cavity, head and neck. Dental services may also include
medically necessary adjunctive dental treatment (e.g., preventive dental treatment prior to
radiation therapy, management of oral side effects from chemotherapy, fabrication of
maxillofacial prostheses, etc). Treatments and procedures that are elective in nature (which
includes most cosmetic care) should only be performed if required in support of residency
training, to conduct approved scientific research protocols, or to maintain staff competency. The
CDS will determine which specific dental services will be provided at the dental treatment
facility (DTF) based on staffing, facilities available and mission requirements using current AF
and/or DOD guidance. (T-2) Required dental services that cannot be provided in the DTF may
be referred to the private sector. Elective care should not be referred to the private sector. For
Air Reserve Component (ARC) only- Dental Services are solely diagnostic for providing
Dental Readiness Classifications (DRC) through examinations or verifying DRC recommended
by civilian providers.
     2.1. Clinical management of patients will be conducted IAW the most current Air Force
     Medical Service (AFMS) Dental Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). (T-1)
     2.2. Management of AF dental clinics will be conducted IAW the most current Dental
     Management Guide (DMG). (T-2)
     2.3. Air Force Reserve Component (AFRC) units will utilize the most current AFRC Dental
     Consolidated Policy Memorandum for patient management. (T-1)
3. Priority of Care. The CDS must establish local procedures to ensure AD personnel (to
include Reserve Component personnel on active status) maintain optimal dental health. (T-0)
Reserve Component members on AD tours are entitled to the same medical and dental care
authorized for members of the regular component, during the period of duty specified in their
orders. Dental services and treatment at AF dental facilities are prioritized in this order:
AFI47-101 20 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                       3


   3.1. Authorized beneficiaries with dental emergencies.
   3.2. AD personnel in DRC 4.
   3.3. AD personnel in DRC 3.
   3.4. AD personnel in DRC 2.
   3.5. Command-sponsored AD family members may receive dental treatment at OCONUS
   locations IAW current DoD/HA and Air Force policy.
   3.6. All others IAW current DOD/HA and Air Force policy.
4. Air Force Dental Readiness Assurance Program (AFDRAP). The CDS must ensure all
local dental programs and activities supporting the dental readiness of military forces are
incorporated into the AFDRAP. At a minimum, this program will include:
   4.1. Providing military members periodic dental examinations and risk-based assessment for
   oral diseases and conditions that might compromise individual readiness. (T-0)
   4.2. Providing/Verifying DRC (see DODI 6025.19, Enclosure 4). (T-0)
   4.3. Monitoring and providing priority care for AD patients in DRC 3 and 4. (T-1)
   4.4. Providing AD dental clearances. (T-0)
   4.5. Monitoring availability and accessibility of dental services for AD personnel, to include
   private sector care, if used. (T-0)
5. Urgent and Emergent Dental Care (AD only). The CDS will develop a process to ensure
authorized beneficiaries are able to access emergent (immediate response) and urgent care
(within 24 hours) for acute dental conditions in a timely manner and will periodically evaluate its
performance in accordance with the most current AFMS Dental CPGs. (T-1)
6. Rated Personnel. The CDS will ensure all dental personnel understand their responsibilities
for treating rated personnel. (T-1) Monitor and treat personnel on flying status IAW AFI 48-123,
Medical Examinations and Standards, Aerospace Medicine Operations and the most current
Dental Management Guide. (T-1) Treatment of rated personnel and recommendation parameters
that support, deny or return individuals to Flying or Special Operations Duty will be coordinated
with Aerospace Medicine. (T-1)
   6.1. Dental clinics will notify the flight surgeon using AF Form 1418, Recommendation for
   Flying or Special Operations Duty - Dental, or electronically generated equivalent, to
   recommend to Flight Medicine if commanders should restrict a member’s rated duties after
   dental treatment or when a rated member is placed in DRC 3. (T-1) Aerospace medicine
   completes AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational
   Duty.
7. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP)/Sensitive Duties Program (SDP). The CDS will
ensure all dental personnel understand their responsibilities involving the PRP/SDP. (T-0)
Monitor and treat members who are in sensitive duty positions or work with nuclear weapons as
specified in DOD5210.42R_AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability
Program.

8. Refusal of Dental Treatment. Refusal of necessary dental treatment is incompatible with
retention in the USAF. The CDS must explain the value and necessity of proper oral health care
to all AD patients who refuse treatment. If a member in DRC 3 or 4 still refuses dental care, the
CDS must report the refusal to the member’s commander, including information about the
possible effects that an adverse dental condition may have on the individual’s duty performance
and readiness capability. (T-1)
9. Postmortem Dental Identification. Each AD dental facility must be able to perform or
provide for (e.g., collocated Army or Navy facility) postmortem dental identifications. (T-2)
     9.1. The CDS must assign a credentialed and privileged dental team leader to each
     postmortem identification team. (T-2)
10. Occupational Safety and Health
     10.1. Regulatory Responsibilities. The CDS will ensure that dental facilities meet all health
     and safety requirements for staff, patients and visitors. Dental personnel must comply with
     federal, Air Force, state and local jurisdiction Occupational Safety and Health Administration
     regulatory standards. (T-0)
        10.1.1. Hazardous Material Management. Dental Personnel must meet the requirements
        of AFMAN 48-155, Occupational and Environmental Health Exposure Controls.
        Hazardous materials in the dental clinic must be stored and maintained IAW AFI 32-
        7086, Hazardous Material Management Program or appropriate guidance. (T-0)
        10.1.2. Amalgam Waste Handling Procedures. Dental personnel must meet the
        requirements outlined in the most current AF Dental Service guidance related to
        Amalgam Waste Handling. (T-0)
        10.1.3. Infection Prevention and Control Procedures. Dental personnel, in coordination
        with the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) infection control committee, must meet the
        requirements outlined in the most current USAF Guidelines for Infection Prevention &
        Control in Dentistry, AFI 44-108, Infection Prevention and Control Program, and local
        MTF instructions. (T-0)
        10.1.4. Radiology. The CDS will ensure dental staff and patients receive the lowest
        possible radiation dose consistent with the current Air Force Dental Service Digital
        Diagnostic Imaging Guidelines. (T-0)
        10.1.5. Industrial Hygiene and Environment of Care. The CDS should coordinate with
        Bioenvironmental Engineering to ensure compliance with Industrial Hygiene and
        Environment of Care guidelines.
