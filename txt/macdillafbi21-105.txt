1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. The 6th Maintenance Group Commander (6 MXG/CC) and 6 OG/CC have joint responsibility
   for the effective management of the FCF/OCF and HSTC programs. The Maintenance and Operations
   communities will work closely together in planning and conducting unit-level FCF/OCF and HSTCs.

    1.2. The maintenance focal point for FCF/OCF and HSTC matters is Quality Assurance (QA). The
    operations focal point for FCF/OCF and HSTC matters is the FCF Officer in Charge (OIC), desig-
    nated here as the 6 Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation Office (6 OG/OGV). QA and 6
    OG/OGV will work closely together to ensure the FCF/OCF and HSTC are performed safely and by
    the most qualified aircrew available.
    1.3. When an FCF/OCF or HSTC is requested; 6 OG/OGV with proper coordination will decide if a
    Stan/Eval (or other suitably qualified) aircrew should accomplish the FCF/OCF or HSTC. High-speed
    taxi checks will be accomplished with qualified FCF aircrews and accomplished with applicable air-
    craft Dash 1 series publications and maintenance T.O.s.

2. Procedures.
    2.1. FCF/OCF will be accomplished in accordance with the following T.O.s: T.O. 1-1-300, Accep-
    tance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance OPR Checks; T.O. 1C-135-6, Aircraft Scheduled
    Inspection and Maintenance Requirements; applicable Mission Design Series (MDS)
    1C-135(K)R(1)-1, Flight Manual KC-135R/T; 1C-135(K)R(1)-6CF-1, -135 Acceptance and/or Func-
    tional Check Flight Procedures Manual; 1C-135(K)R(1)-6CL-1, -135 Pilot Acceptance and/or Func-
    tional Check Flight Checklist; 1C-135(K)R(1)-6CL-2, -135 Navigator Acceptance and/or Functional
    Check Flight Checklist; 1C-135(K)R(1)-6CL-3, -135 Boom Operator Acceptance and/or Functional
    Check Flight Checklist.
    2.2. FCF/OCF will be performed upon completion of other maintenance/repair actions (i.e., Canni-
    balizations (CANN)) where the owning squadron (6th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron / 6th Mainte-
    nance Squadron (6 AMXS/6 MXS)) supervision deems an FCF/OCF is appropriate and the 6 MXG/
    CC or designated representative signs the FCF/OCF recommendation letter (Attachment 2). Check
    Flights and HSTCs will be performed during daylight hours under visual meteorological conditions.
    Configure aircraft with the minimum fuel practical to accomplish high-speed taxi checks to minimize
    brake and tire wear. Aircrews performing high-speed taxi checks will compute takeoff data. All air-
    craft forms entries will be documented in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Main-
    tenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
NOTE: Ensure enough fuel is onboard to execute a takeoff, a normal radar pattern, and landing with
applicable reserves should unexpected circumstances require takeoff.
    2.3. The 6 AMXS Production Superintendent and/or the 6 MXS Production Superintendent will:
       2.3.1. Notify the 6th Maintenance Operations Squadron (6 MOS) Scheduling and QA of the
       requirement for an FCF/OCF or HSTC, providing them with the aircraft type and reason for the
       FCF/OCF or HSTC requirement.
       2.3.2. Ensure required personnel and aircraft transcribed forms are readily available for review by
       the FCF/OCF and HSTC, QA program manager, and aircrew at the designated time and place for
       the FCF/OCF or HSTC prior-to-flight aircrew briefing.
       2.3.3. Ensure the appropriate specialists attend crew debriefings after FCF/OCF flights or HSTC.
    2.4. MOS Scheduling will:
       2.4.1. Confirm the need for the FCF/OCF or HSTC, notify Operations Scheduling, provide them
       with the aircraft type and tail number, and request a time and place for the FCF/OCF or HSTC air-
       crew briefing.

     coordinate with 6 OG/OGV the requirements to be performed during the FCF/OCF or HSTC and
     prepare the FCF/OCF checklist. Prior to FCF/OCF crew briefing, review aircraft AFTO
     781-series forms, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, for all corrective/completed
     actions and place a preprinted copy of AFTO 781A (Attachment 3) in the aircraft forms binder.

     zation with aircraft ownership and the 6th Air Mobility Wing, Flight Safety Office (6 AMW/SEF)
     of the time and place of the FCF/OCF/HSTC prior-to-flight aircrew briefing.
         2.5.3.1. Owning aircraft organization will ensure maintenance personnel are immediately
         available to answer aircrew questions such as discrepancy and corrective actions for the condi-
         tion(s) requiring the FCF/OCF/HSTC.
     2.5.4. Brief and explain the purpose of the FCF/OCF or HSTC using the FCF/OCF/HSTC Brief-
