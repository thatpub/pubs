SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been changed to reflect the transfer of the bomber global strike mission
from Air Combat Command (ACC) to Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). This

document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
incorporates recent AFI 10-703 and AFGSCI 10-707 policy and guidance changes governing
electronic combat training and reprogramming operations.
1. General.
1.1. C&SRL list are the primary lists used during HQ AFGSC/IG Compliance Inspections (CI)
to access unit compliance with guidance governing each particular area of operations. Items
in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ AFGSC and, as applicable, ANG and AFRC , staffs and
based upon existing statutory requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF and AFGSC
guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF, AFGSC and/or ANG leadership to assessing
and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to
identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Additionally, when
applying this C&SRL, units and inspectors are advised to reference their specific weapon
system/Major Design System (MDS) Aircrew Training series as subtle variances between the
weapon systems addressed in this C&SRL may exist. In this case, the MDS-specific instruction
will take precedence. When published, HAF/MAJCOM Supplemental checklist will take
precedence over C&SRLs. Units will obtain applicable HAF/MAJCOM Supplemental checklist
from the AF Checklist site (https://wwwmil.afrc.af.mil/afia/).
1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection items
and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs) and the
missions areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core and General
Compliance Items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the CI, it is the intent of
the evaluation team to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that apply to the inspected
unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection. Critical, core
and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objectives. An item or area where unit failure to comply with
established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or
significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
- Airman development programs
- Ability to deploy forces
- Ability to employ forces
CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and is
important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance
would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or
possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to successful
overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation. GCIs are shown
in sentence case format.
