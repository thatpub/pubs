     2.3.1.2. (AFMC) AFMC/A3V certified evaluators are authorized to administer any
     evaluation type within their aircrew specialty/weapon system and on those missions in
     which they maintain qualification, for any AFMC flying organization or AFRC flying
     organization under OPCON to AFMC
     2.3.1.3. HQ USAF DRUs and the ANG Bureau (ANGB) are considered MAJCOMs for
     purposes of this instruction.
  2.3.2. Functions.
     2.3.2.1. In coordination with the appropriate lead MAJCOM, develop and manage
     applicable AFI11-2MDS, Vol 2, MDS XX - Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
         2.3.2.1.1. Some Volumes 2 may be aircrew specific [such as the Aeromedical
         Evacuation (AE) series] and some may be functionally specific [such as the Flight
         Test (FT) series].
         2.3.2.1.1. (AFMC) AFMC produces a three-volume set of Flight Test (FT)
         instructions containing attachments for each weapon system flown in AFMC. These
         instructions are numbered AFI 11-2FT Volume 1, 2, and 3, and will contain the
         training, evaluation criteria, and operations procedures, respectively, for each weapon
         system. AFMC uses these instructions in lieu of AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific volumes for
         flying operations.
         2.3.2.1.2. MAJCOM functionals will determine policy precedence for
         AE/FT/PJ/CRO/GA and MDS-Specific policy guidance, in coordination with the
         other AFI OPRs. Policy guidance in other series AFIs will not be less restrictive than
         guidance contained in this AFI and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
         2.3.2.1.2. (AFMC) In the absence of published guidance, AFMC units will
         coordinate with HQ AFMC/A3V for approval of locally developed guidelines. These
         guidelines should be consistent with similar guidance specified in the appropriate AFI
         11-2 MDS-Specific volumes. In addition, aircraft on loan to AFMC undergoing short-
         term flight test programs will be flown according to the lead MAJCOM guidance if
         no AFMC guidance exists. Flying units are only required to maintain MDS
         attachments for their applicable aircraft operations.
     2.3.2.2. Convene conferences and working groups, as necessary, to review and improve
     command Stan/Eval policies and procedures.

     2.4.2.5. Provide qualified flight examiners to augment other MAJCOM and NAF
     agencies when requested (see paragraph 2.3.5).
     2.4.2.6. Administer periodic flight evaluations, when practical, to Chiefs of Stan/Eval or
     senior Stan/Eval crews in lower echelon units, in gained units, and in AFRC/ANG units
     for which oversight responsibility is assigned.
     2.4.2.6. (AFMC) Commanders (Center, Wing, & Group), Chiefs of Stan/Eval, (Group
     level or higher) and CCPs will receive required evaluations from an AFMC/A3V
     designated examiner. Unit (squadron or detachment) commanders and unit chiefs of
     stan/eval will receive required evaluations from the next higher level of stan/eval. OG/CC
     concurrence is not required for AFRC units under OPCON to AFMC. Evaluation
     requests must be coordinated with AFMC/A3V no later than two weeks in advance of the
     desired evaluation date. If AFMC/A3V is unable to provide an evaluator, an alternate will
     be designated. Document on the AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Certification,
     Section D, Additional Comments, with the name and date of the approving official from
     AFMC/A3V.
     2.4.2.7. Observe execution of unit missions and provide feedback when feasible.
     2.4.2.7. (AFMC) HHQ evaluators may fly for the purpose of promoting standardization
     in mission, MDS, or crew functional areas with any AFMC unit or AFRC unit with
     OPCON to AFMC. The examiner may log evaluator time if qualified and certified as an
     evaluator in the aircraft, otherwise log ―O‖ or ―X‖ IAW AFI 11-401.
     2.4.2.8. Review and coordinate on subordinate unit supplements to this instruction.
     2.4.2.8. (AFMC) Units will forward supplements to AFMC/A3V for coordination,
     review, and final approval.
     2.4.2.9. Review subordinate unit Stan/Eval Board (SEB) minutes and, at a minimum,
     address any action items requiring HHQ assistance.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                   15


   2.4.3. Organization. Typical NAF Stan/Eval staff includes a chief and one flight examiner
   per crew position per MDS. Manning may be adjusted by the NAF Commander.
   2.4.4. Augmentation. Each NAF may use qualified augmentees to support or conduct
   reviews, evaluations, and inspections with concurrence of all the NAF Stan/Eval
   organizations involved.
2.5. Stan/Eval Visits (SEVs). HHQ Stan/Eval staffs may visit units during the administration
of formal inspections (e.g. Unit Compliance Inspections), Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs), or in
an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM supplements.
2.5. (AFMC)This paragraph and sub-paragraphs supersedes and replaces guidance found
in AFMCI 90-203. AFMC/A3V is tasked by AFMC/CC through AFMC/A3 to conduct unit
Aircrew Performance Evaluations, (APE), SAVs, and formal compliance inspections on units
that conduct flying operations and parachute jump operations. Inspections of any or all
operations areas will be tasked by exception when necessary and directed by the Chief of
AFMC/A3V.          AFMC/A3V will APE each unit approximately once every 24 months and
conduct SAVs within 12 months of the past APE evaluation. Compliance verification with
USAF, AFMC and unit guidance is one objective of this program with the additional and more
critical objective to APE evaluate aircrew and jumper performance in the conduct of their
mission. All AFMC flying units and Air Force Reserve units under AFMC Operational Control
(OPCON) are subject to the provisions of this instruction. NAF coordination for AFRC units
under OPCON to AFMC is not required.
   2.5.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC/IG inspects AFMC units for compliance. All aircrew flying
   related records are considered within the scope of AFMC/A3V SAVs and evaluations. There
   are seven major operations areas that are covered by this Stan/Eval program; aircrew
   performance, jumper performance, flight operations, flying training, aircrew standardization-
   evaluation, contractor operations, and aircrew flight equipment. Aircrew Performance
   Evaluations and Jumper Performance Evaluations are the key tool to evaluate the
   performance of aircrew and jumper personnel accomplishing the unit assigned mission. All
   AFMC flying organizations and AF Reserve units under AFMC operational control are
   subject to APE/JPE evaluation program.
   2.5.2. (Added-AFMC) Units will be APE/JPE evaluated in a vulnerability window of 12-
   30 months and on an approximate 24-month command average cycle. Individual unit
   evaluations will be scheduled based on past performance with stronger performance trending
   toward the 30-month interval. Units will be given little to no-notice (24 hours minimum) of
   commencement of APE/JPEs. The Chief of AFMC/A3V will provide formal notification to
   the supervision of the unit by any communications means available or necessary. The three
   evaluation subareas of APE/JPEs are testing, publications, and aircrew/jumper evaluations.
   The exams, publications checks, and EPEs that occur during a visit may be recorded and
   used as requisites for a subsequent instrument or qualification evaluation, provided all other
   requisites are completed within the guidelines established by this publication. Initiation of an
   APE/JPE will typically flow from testing and publications review on the first day to aircrew
   and jumper evaluations on subsequent days until the specific evaluation quantity objectives
   have been met. APE/JPE team travel costs are funded by AFMC/A3.
       2.5.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Testing: Aircraft MQF, Non-MQF aircraft knowledge, flight
       instructions and published guidance, and aircraft CAPS/Boldface are components of
16                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     testing. Testing is required for all qualified aircrew members who are not TDY, DNIF to
     quarters, on emergency/planned leave, or participating in an actual test mission. At least
     90 percent of available aircrew must test for the unit to complete the APE/JPE testing
     evaluation with a rating of excellent or higher. All qualified aircrew members must test
     unless excused by the Team Chief. Contractor aircrews will test in their respective crew
     position/aircraft specialty, or IAW procedures established and coordinated with the GFR.
     All aircrew members who are multiple qualified must complete tests for each aircraft in
     which they are qualified. In addition to test questions all aircrew members whose aircraft
     have BOLDFACE/CAPS will complete a written examination on those items.
        2.5.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Testing MQF or BOLDFACE/CAPS failures will be
        reported to the flying unit commander immediately. Aircrew who fail the MQF
        testing portion or BOLDFACE/CAPS will be grounded immediately and re-evaluated
        prior to the next flight. An unqualified (3) AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew
        Qualification, will be completed by AFMC/A3V and placed in the aircrew member’s
        FEF.
        2.5.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) For rated officers (Pilots, WSOs, Navigators/CSOs),
        tests will be 40 questions; 20 derived from aircraft specific MQFs, 10 non-MQF
        questions derived from the aircraft specific flight manuals covering notes, warnings,
        cautions; operations limits; normal and emergency procedures; and 10 questions
        derived from the following flight/instrument instructions, and other applicable
        guidance: AFI 11-202 Vol 3, General Flight Rules; AFI 11-2 FT Vol 3, AFMC Flight
        Test Operations Procedures; AFMAN 11-217, Instrument Flight Procedures; AFI
        11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground; AFH 11-203, Weather for
        Aircrews; APAM 11-216, Air Navigation, and other applicable guidance such as unit
        supplements and local aircrew guides (IFG) etc.
        2.5.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) For career enlisted aviator (CEA) primary aircrew tests
        will be 30 questions; 20 questions derived from the aircraft specific MQF, and 10
        questions derived from the aircraft specific flight manual covering notes, warnings,
        cautions; operations limits; normal and emergency procedures.
        2.5.2.1.4. (Added-AFMC) For career enlisted aviator and rated mission aircrew
        (CSO, FA, ABM, ASO, MCC, AMT, Scanner, etc) and Non-Rated (X-prefix) tests
        will be 20 questions derived from the aircraft specific MQF.
        2.5.2.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Government Civilians and Contractor personnel will test
        according to their like military specialties as listed above.
        2.5.2.1.6. (Added-AFMC) The MQF portion of the tests administered during an
        evaluation will qualify as the closed book portion of the instrument/qualification
        recurring evaluation requisites. At the unit commander’s discretion, they may also
        count as a periodic test to be used as part of the unit go/no-go process.
     2.5.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Flight Publications: Individual flight publications, checklists,
     and in-flight guide evaluation. Each primary aircrew member’s publications (Flight
     Manual, Checklists, and In-flight Guides) will be evaluated for completeness and
     currency. At least 90 percent of available aircrew publications must be evaluated for the
     unit to complete the flight publication portion of the APE/JPE with a rating of excellent
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  17


     or higher. The quantity of publications varies from aircraft to aircraft; however, expect all
     technical orders, checklists, and in-flight guides to be evaluated. For units that maintain
     individual aircrew technical order publications using electronic means each individual’s
     ―storage‖ media (typically CD-ROM) will be provided for publications evaluation.
     Assigned aircrew may be asked to demonstrate use of the CD-ROM/Electronic Technical
     Order in an appropriate viewing device, such as a desktop computer or Electronic T.O.
     viewer and knowledge of outstanding supplements and/or operating procedures.
     2.5.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Evaluations: Qualification, Instrument, Spot, Instructor,
     Mission.
        2.5.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Flight and ground evaluations will be administered
        during each evaluation visit. The number of evaluations given is based on aircrew
        and aircraft availability. While no minimum number of evaluations is required, it is
        desired to evaluate the unit supervision, unit chief of Stan/Eval, and other unit aircrew
        with a minimum goal of 30% (by aircraft and crew position) of assigned and attached
        aircrew receiving an evaluation.
        2.5.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Instrument, qualification and spot checks will be
        administered. Spot checks may be administered by an AFMC/A3V designated
        evaluator who is not be qualified in the evaluation aircraft, but holds a different
        aircraft qualification. SEFE objectivity checks will be given to evaluate unit SEFE
        compliance and judgment when performing the evaluator role.
        2.5.2.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Ground emergency procedure evaluations (EPE) will
        also be administered to evaluate aircrew knowledge of emergency procedures,
        general knowledge, and CRM principles. This EPE will cover as a minimum all
        boldface/CAPS (if applicable), knowledge of aircraft systems, plus various
        emergency situations which could occur during the performance of the unit’s primary
        mission.
        2.5.2.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Flight evaluations accomplished during APE/JPE will be
        documented with AF Forms 8/8a’s. AFMC/A3V evaluators will prepare the AF
        Form 8/8a on the unit examinee to include examiner remarks and Block 1 signature.
        All SPOT evaluations will be completed and the AF Form 8/8a will be closed out.
        Units being evaluated will accomplish all other AF Forms 8/8a actions. The unit’s
        process for logging, preparing, and tracking unit prepared AF Forms 8/8a will be
        observed as part of the formal unit evaluation.
     2.5.2.4. (Added-AFMC) APE/JPE Ratings. The APE/JPE overall rating is derived from
     combining unit performance in the three sub-areas of testing, publications, and
     evaluations. These three are weighted by the Chief of AFMC/A3V based on specific
     objective criteria contained in AFMC/A3V OI 11-1. The aircrew and jumper performance
     during evaluations is the more significant factor followed by testing and lastly
     publications. The unit grade assigned will follow the five-tier narrative grades of:
     Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory.
     2.5.2.5. (Added-AFMC) Outstanding          Performers.    Commendable         and     top
     aircrew/jumper performers could be identified during the evaluation. Selection is based
     on overall individual performance as well as observed contribution to the unit mission in
18                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     the operations areas. When possible, a digital photograph, if available, of Outstanding
     Performers may be included in the report and final out-brief.
     2.5.2.6. (Added-AFMC) The Chief of AFMC/A3V and/or team chief for unit visits will
     coordinate with local unit commanders for aircrew members to accomplish continuation
     training during HHQ visits.
  2.5.3. (Added-AFMC) Staff Assistance Visits.
     2.5.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Units will be SAV scheduled and assessed 12 months
     following the last APE. This will provide SAV opportunity on a command average 24
     month cycle and execute a compliance review of the unit as they enter the next APE zone
     of 12-30 months. Exception: 412 OG and subordinate units: SAV will be a single event
     and scheduled via A3V and 412 OG coordination on a 24 month cycle. AFMC/A3V will
     coordinate with units to determine the scope and operations areas to be reviewed during
     the SAV. A minimum ―footprint‖ concept will be utilized, typically one aircrew and one
     flight equipment A3V staff member for 2 working days per squadron/det unit. The field
     unit receiving the SAV will fund SAV team travel/TDY costs.
     2.5.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Operations areas are flight operations, aircrew training,
     Stan/Eval, contractor operations, and aircrew flight equipment. SAV results will be
     documented with a letter report to the unit from the SAV team chief. The SAV will not
     assign grades. Formal responses to the report are not required unless specifically
     required in the report. Formal responses are generally associated with repeat write-ups or
     issues affecting safety of flight. Checklists for compliance in various operations areas are
     available on the AFMC/A3V CoP.
  2.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Formal Inspections: Units will be formally inspected in any or all
  operations areas when directed by the Chief of AFMC/A3V. The desire is that requirements
  for formal inspections will be minimal and be invoked only when significant compliance or
  performance issues are in question.
     2.5.4.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC/A3V will notify a unit 45 days prior to commencement
     of a formal flight operations inspection to allow for corrective actions and preparation by
     the unit. Inspections will assess the unit compliance with USAF, AFMC and unit
     guidance in the areas outlined in the SAV portion of this guidance.
     2.5.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Additionally, during an Inspection an APE/JPE will be
     conducted. A formal report will be generated to document findings and area grades will
     be assigned in the operations areas inspected. Inspection team travel costs are AFMC/A3
     funded.
     2.5.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Inspection Ratings. Unit, area, and sub-area ratings are
     derived using objective and subjective means. This allows the inspection team chief to
     compensate and modify ratings based on relevant intangible factors. Ratings will be
     determined after considering the difficulty and magnitude of tasks for each individual
     unit. Overall unit/squadron ratings will be given using a five-tier scale.
         2.5.4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Outstanding: Exceeds all requirements; A model for
         others to emulate. At least half of the areas/sub-areas will be rated outstanding with
         no rating below excellent.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                 19


        2.5.4.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Excellent: Met or exceeded requirements; No repeat
        discrepancies. At least half of the areas/sub-areas will be at least excellent, with no
        rating below satisfactory. APE/JPE performance must be rated at least excellent.
        2.5.4.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Satisfactory: Complied with intent; discrepancies did not
        impact unit mission effectiveness. At least half of the areas/sub-areas will be at least
        satisfactory, with no rating below marginal. APE/JPE performance must be rated
        satisfactory or higher.
        2.5.4.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Marginal: Most requirements met; discrepancies
        degraded unit effectiveness. At least half of the areas/sub-areas will be at least
        marginal. APE/JPE performance must be rated marginal or higher.
        2.5.4.3.5. (Added-AFMC) Unsatisfactory: Did not comply with directives; unit
        mission impacts observed. If APE/JPE performance is rated unsatisfactory, the
        overall rating will be unsatisfactory.
     2.5.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Inspection Findings. Inspection reports will contain specific
     finding comments aside from descriptive verbiage. Discrepancies are significant errors
     that demand attention or action to correct, actions or in-action that violate regulations,
     manuals, guidance, instructions, or violations of safety procedures. Some discrepancies
     may be corrected immediately; however, some may require revamping or implementation
     of specific programs to correct. All discrepancies, whether corrected on the spot, or
     requiring new or revised programs must be answered in writing.
     2.5.4.5. (Added-AFMC) If a unit receives an overall unit grade of
     UNSATISFACTORY or MARGINAL, AFMC/A3V will return to the unit within 90
     days to re-inspect the unsatisfactory or marginal areas. The intent of this supplementary
     inspection will be to verify that processes and procedures are in place to prevent the
     recurrence of these discrepancies.
     2.5.4.6. (Added-AFMC) Written answers to discrepancies must be forwarded to
     AFMC/A3V within 30 days of the inspection report date. Answers should outline the
     programs, written policies, and procedures instituted since the inspection that will prevent
     the discrepancy from reoccurring. Programs instituted by the unit prior to the inspection
     will also be outlined in the response if they are designed as corrective action to a
     deficiency exposed during the inspection.
  2.5.5. (Added-AFMC) APE/JPE, SAV and Inspection Support.
     2.5.5.1. (Added-AFMC) SAV Support. The Host unit will coordinate and provide unit
     funding fund cite authorization 30 days prior to the start of a SAV.
     2.5.5.2. (Added-AFMC) Aircrew/Jumper Performance Evaluation Support. Due to the
     short/no-notice nature of APE/JPEs, the Host unit may be unable to coordinate and
     provide all of the support items desired. However, unit POCs should do everything
     possible to provide the following items.
        2.5.5.2.1. (Added-AFMC) A current aircrew qualification roster (letter of x’s) via
        MAJCOM operations software be updated as well as projected weekly flying
        schedule, key personnel list and Unit Mission Statement be forwarded to A3V POC.
20                           AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


        2.5.5.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Ground Transportation (motor pool, GSA motor pool, or
        rental vehicles). The unit POC is requested to be available at team arrival with access
        to government ground transportation to distribute.
        2.5.5.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Rooms for in-brief, out-brief, aircrew testing,
        publications checks, and team work center. In/out-brief rooms should be capable of
        MS Office PowerPoint projection. The testing area should allow all unit personnel to
        test as a group in the same room. Team work center should be large enough for seven
        evaluators with work areas large enough to inspect all unit personnel publications;
        unless a separate room is provided for publication inspections. If facilities are
        inadequate for testing and publications, the unit POC will coordinate with the
        AFMC/A3V POC to identify different shifts or locations for testing and publications
        inspections.
        2.5.5.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Computer requirements are at least one desktop
        computer with access to a printer. Software needs will vary with release and purchase
        of new office software by USAF. The latest version of MS Office is required. While
        LAN/Internet connections are not mandatory, they are strongly desired. Copier
        requirements are one copier (access only) with appropriate passwords if required.
        Access to a shredder is also required.
        2.5.5.2.5. (Added-AFMC) Telephone requirements are a minimum of one class A
        DSN lines plus LAN/Internet if available. A comprehensive in-brief from the unit
        commander or his representative will be delivered immediately following the HQ
        AFMC/A3V in-brief.
     2.5.5.3. (Added-AFMC) Inspection Support. The Host unit will coordinate and provide
     the following, as applicable, 30 days prior to the start of a formal inspection. See
     APE/JPE support requirements.

                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.
       3.2.1.2. Designate OG Stan/Eval (OGV) flight examiners (see paragraph 4.2.3).
       3.2.1.3. Provide the means to procure the necessary materials for mission planning, pre-
       flight briefings, and flying supervision.
       3.2.1.4. Provide a suitable Stan/Eval testing area.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations (see Chapter 9).
       3.2.1.6. Chair the SEB.
       3.2.1.7. Establish procedures to implement MAJCOM-mandated Stan/Eval software.
   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
       3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
       of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
       Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
       3.2.2.1. (46TW) References to ―OGV‖ in this supplement refer to 46 OG/OGV for the
       46 OG. For the 46 TG, 586 FLTS/DOV will assume both OGV and squadron-level
       Stan/Eval (SQ/DOV) responsibilities unless stated otherwise.
       3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
       3.2.2.2. (46TW) 46 OG/OGV in conjunction with SQ/DOV will review and maintain
       quality control of AF Forms 8/8a.
          3.2.2.2.1. (Added-46TW) Squadron Stan/ Eval personnel and SEFEs will adhere to
          the formatting of the Sample AF Forms 8/8a in Attachment 3 of AFI 11-202v2
          AFMC Sup1 to the max extent possible. If available space on a Form 8 is
          insufficient, double spaces may be eliminated between paragraphs.
          3.2.2.2.2. (Added-46TW) AF Form 8/8a signature routing will be via COOL to the
          max extent possible. If any of the signature authorities in Block III do not have
22                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


        COOL access a paper copy or IMT version of the AF Form 8/8a will be created,
        signed and uploaded into COOL. If necessary, this signature may be digitally
        transcribed to the back of the AF Form 8/8a if used in conjunction with a periodic
        evaluation with multiple quals. Routing of paper copies for signature will be routed
        from the evaluator to the SQ/DOV, Reviewing Officer, Final Approving Officer, and

   AF Form 8/8a, additional comments. The Out-of-Command evaluator will be briefed on the
   specifics of AFMC evaluations. The unit using these evaluators will be responsible for
   properly documenting the evaluation in accordance with this supplement. Note: Use of
   DCMA evaluators does not constitute an Out-of-Command evaluation and may administer
   evaluations without pre-approval from AFMC/A3V.
   4.3.5. (46TW) Aircrew members that are qualified in any AFSOC MDS will comply with
   the requirements of the AFMC/AFSOC/AFRC MOA. They will take the appropriate AFSOC
   MDS tests and receive an evaluation from an appropriately qualified evaluator.

                                           Chapter 5

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.1. (AFMC) A post flight video review does not meet the intent of an in-flight evaluation
   and may not be used as an alternate evaluation method.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
   5.1.2. (AFMC) All AFMC aircrew (rated, CEA, and non-rated) require an evaluation
   consisting ground and/or flight phases. Government civilians and contractor aircrew in like
   positions will complete like evaluations. Examples of like duties/positions for non-rated
   aircrew include flight test engineer, test director, test conductor or instrumentation. There are
   no crewmembers that gain qualification through an examination only. The guidance in
   Chapter 8 is not applicable to AFMC flight operations.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
5.2. (AFMC)Profiles for qualification/instrument/instructor evaluations will be conducted
in accordance with the prescribed worksheets (found on the AFMC/A3V website) for each
aircraft and crew position and with the applicable flight test grading criteria contained in
AFI 11-2FTV2. Conduct difference/conversion evaluations IAW MDS-specific guidance.
Recurring evaluations are then conducted in any series of a particular mission/design aircraft in
which qualified.
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
       5.2.1.2. (AFMC) Some crew specialties may be combined if the duties of both crew
       positions are accomplished on the same flight. (Examples: B-1 OSO/ DSO; AC-130
       Nav/FCO).
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  33


     5.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Non-Rated Aircrew Qualification. AFMC assigned/attached
     Non-rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefix) do not require a flight phase for the qualification
     evaluation. The evaluation will, as a minimum, consist of a closed book examination,
     Boldface/CAPs (if applicable), and an aircraft egress / emergency equipment ground
     evaluation completed on a representative aircraft. Egress certified simulators for ejection
     seat aircraft may be used in conjunction with or in lieu of an actual aircraft. Any pilot of
     an ejection seat aircraft that is a certified evaluator may complete the evaluation. Any
     aircrew member that can complete ship side egress requirements that is a certified
     evaluator may complete the evaluation (i.e. C-130J Evaluator Loadmaster certified to
     instruct egress may complete the QUAL evaluation for a Flight Test Engineer). Units
     may be more restrictive if mission requirements dictate. (Open and closed book
     examinations, flight evaluation, etc). Detailed requirements by position will be listed in
     unit supplements.         There is no requirement for instructor and/or evaluator
     qualification/certification for these crew positions.
     5.2.1.3. (46TW) Non-rated aircrew members will be evaluated on life support
     equipment, egress procedures and crew coordination relevant to aircraft for which they
     are being qualified. Crew coordination discussions should focus on their role in assisting
     primary crew members in handling emergencies as well as assisting in test mission
     accomplishment. For example, Mission Aircrew (Photographers, Flight Test Engineers,
     etc.) evaluations could involve discussion of monitoring flight test parameters and
     communicating significant deviations, handling of in-flight emergencies (out-of-control,
     ejection altitudes, etc.).
     5.2.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Flight Surgeons assigned/attached to AFMC flying
     organizations will comply with the guidance for Non-Rated Aircrew Qualification listed
     above.
  5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
     5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
     Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
     5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
     USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
     successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
     5.2.2.2. (AFMC) Instrument flight evaluations are required for all initial aircraft
     qualifications and re-qualifications. If the aircrew member has not completed IRC within
     the previous four quarters, the course must be completed prior to the flight portion of the
     AF Form 8 evaluation.
        5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
        11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
        pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
        5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
        aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
        INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
34                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


        5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
        under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
        requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
        5.2.2.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Navigators/CSOs with flight instruments used for
        navigation at their station must attend a periodic instrument refresher. Complete an
        instrument exam as a requisite to the qualification evaluation. If the aircrew member
        has not completed IRC within the previous four quarters, the course must be
        completed prior to the flight portion for all initial qualification or RQ AF Form 8
        evaluations.
        5.2.2.2.5. (Added-AFMC) Weapon Systems Officers and navigators having flight
        controls at their duty station will complete the pilot instrument exam as a requisite to
        the qualification evaluation. If multiple qualified, complete the instrument exam in
        phase with the qualification evaluation on the primary aircraft. If the aircrew member
        has not completed IRC within the previous four quarters, the course must be
        completed prior to the flight portion for all initial qualification or RQ AF Form 8
        evaluations.
  5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.1. (AFMC) The requirement for a mission evaluation for AFMC aircrews is
     waived. However, evaluators should attempt to include mission type events on a
     qualification evaluation. Mission type events may be any Phase II event such as
     aerobatics, confidence maneuvers, safety chase, approaches to stalls, BFM, flight test
     techniques, formation, basic weapons deliveries, and functional checks, etc. The Mission
     Section of the evaluation sheets contains four areas to be evaluated if mission type events
     are accomplished on a qualification evaluation.
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  35


     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
     5.2.4.2. (AFMC) Whenever possible this evaluation will be conducted from the
     instructor position. If the cockpit layout and/or visibility have differences that are
     significant enough to affect instrument maneuvers or landing techniques, units will add
     appropriate grading areas to evaluate these differences. The instructor upgrade flight
     evaluation requirements apply to all primary aircrew (rated or CEA) positions. Instructor
     comments must be included and described in adequate detail in the mission description
     area of the AF Form 8. As a minimum, the graded areas will include the Ground Phase,
     General, Qualification, and Instructor as defined in the applicable portion of AFI 11-2FT
     Vol 2, Flight Test Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. When instructor status is accepted from
     another MAJCOM, any additional items required to meet AFMC standards (i.e.., Rear
     Cockpit landings in the F-16) will be trained and evaluated IAW SPOT Evaluation
     criteria. See AFI 11-2FT Vol 1, MDS attachments for specific details and requirements.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
        5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
        evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
        MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
        AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
36                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
         5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Standardization/Evaluation            Flight    Examiner      (SEFE)
     Objectivity Evaluations. Senior Flight examiner, OGV, AFMC/A3V, CCP, and HHQ
     designated augmentees administering evaluations on behalf of AFMC/A3V can
     administer a SPOT evaluation. Evaluations may be conducted in flight or ground
     evaluations. The purpose of these evaluations is to evaluate flight examiners within a unit
     on their ability to comply with higher headquarters (HHQ) and local Stan/Eval directives.
     Properly brief and debrief an examinee, correctly identify discrepancies, award the
     correct grade for each evaluated area, award the appropriate overall grade, and, if
     required, assign appropriate additional training. These evaluations are ―over-the-
     shoulder‖ type evaluations and may include Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs),
     qualification, instrument, or instructor evaluations. There are no requisite exams required
     for this evaluation. SEFE Objectivity evaluations will be documented as SPOT
     evaluations in the Flight Phase (or Ground Phase for EPEs) of the AF Form 8.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
         5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
         guidance for that periodic evaluation.
         5.2.6.2.1. (AFMC) Comply with the requirements of paragraph 5.2.4.2 above for
         instructor requalification evaluations.
         5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
         1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
         The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
         those items for which the individual is non-current.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                 37


        5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
        IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
        5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
        Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
        5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
        5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
        5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
        evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. ―Normal
        preparation‖ will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        5.2.6.3.3. (Added-AFMC) With prior notification to the unit commander, the
        AFMC Chief of Stan/Eval may direct HHQ designated flight examiners qualified in
        the aircraft and crew position to replace any scheduled primary aircrew prior to flight
        briefing time. Non-HHQ evaluators, at the direction of the OG/CC, may replace any
        scheduled primary aircrew prior to flight briefing time for the purpose of
        administering a no-notice evaluation.
        5.2.6.3.3. (46TW) No-notice programs and goals are delegated to individual flying
        unit commanders. The SQ/CC, DO or OGV can direct or approve a no-notice
        evaluation on any aircrew assigned/attached for flying to the unit. SQ Flight
        Examiners will not conduct no-notice (N/N) evals on personnel outside their SQ
        unless approved by each SQ/DO or designated representative.
        5.2.6.3.4. (Added-AFMC) No specific requirements are established for the number
        of areas that must be graded on a no-notice evaluation; however, flight examiners will
        evaluate all areas observed and prepare an AF Form 8/8a. When HHQ evaluators fly
        for the purpose of promoting standardization in mission, MDS, or crew functional
        areas, an AF Form 8/8a is not required.
     5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
     in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
     evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
     evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.

5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
          examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
          safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
          5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
          compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
          adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
          constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
          of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
          examiner.
      5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
      either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
          5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
          the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
          discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
          proficiency.
          5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
          remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
             5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
             or flying.
             5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
             of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
             be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
             5.3.2.2.2.2. (AFMC) Additional training required as a result of a Q-2 or Q-3
             evaluation will be completed and a successful requal evaluation (if required)
             accomplished within 60 days. This training will be documented in the individual
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                 39


             training folder as defined by AFI 11-202, Volume1_AFMCS 1.
             5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
             additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
             action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
             8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as ―Commendable‖
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
         5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
         assigned.
         5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
         5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
 40                             AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


       5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
       performance or knowledge.
          5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
          evaluations and EPEs).
          5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
          the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
          requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
          consideration.
          5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
          always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
   5.4.1. (AFMC) AFMC evaluation criteria are published in AFI 11-2FT Vol 2.
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
          5.4.1.1.1. (AFMC) Critical areas are listed on AFMC Forms 59 and/or 72.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                              41


       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
       5.4.1.2. (AFMC) Each aircrew member will submit as a minimum, the applicable Dash-
       1, Dash -1-1 (if issued and required in the performance of duties) and crew position
       checklist as required in AFI 11-2FT Vol 2.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
5.5. (46TW)413 FLTS aircrew              requisites: will    be    accomplished      IAW   the
AFMC/AFSOC/AFRC MOA.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
          5.5.1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) An EPE is a requisite for INSTR Evaluations (Initial or
          RQ)
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
          5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
          and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
          systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
          5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
          evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
          simulator/ATD, or verbally.
42                             AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


         5.5.1.2.2. (AFMC) Units will develop profiles for emergency procedure evaluations
         using the AFMC worksheets as a foundation. These profiles will contain elements of
         the unit’s mission if applicable (i.e., FCF profiles). Flight examiners will tailor
         evaluation profiles using as a minimum the listed requirements on the worksheets.
         Units will use the appropriate overlay of the AFMC Form 59, Aircrew Evaluation
         Sheet (found on the AFMC/A3V website) or the AFMC Form 72, SEFE Objectivity
         Evaluation Sheet to conduct evaluations and to meet the required evaluation profiles.
         5.5.1.2.2. (46TW) SQ/DOV in conjunction with Sq MDS chief pilots will make
         available EPE guides for use by evaluators during EPEs. These guides can be in any
         format deemed necessary by the squadron such as power point slides, briefing guides,
         word documents, etc.
            5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
            evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
            5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
            INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
            cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
            evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
         5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
         the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
         for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
         5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
         examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
         unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
         and 7.3.7.3.4.
         5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
         situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
         circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
         accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
         flight examiner)
         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
  5.5.2. (46TW) F-15 Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) evaluations will be conducted in the
  F-15E only. The 46 OG Flight Examiner’s Guide provides sample profiles for emergency
  procedures evaluations.
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
     5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
     training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                    43


   5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
       5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
       case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
          5.5.3.1.1. (Added-46TW) 46 OG/OGV and 586 FLTS/DOV will administer
          requisite tests via COOL. Exams will be proctored to aircrew at the beginning of their
          checkride zone. 413 FLTS aircrew testing will be accomplished IAW procedures
          established in the AFMC/AFSOC/AFRC MOA.
          5.5.3.1.2. (Added-46TW) For rated aircrew, all evaluation requisites will be
          complete by the end of the fifth month or the examinee will be grounded. Waiver
          authority is the Chief of OGV (Squadron commander for the 586 FLTS). If the flight
          evaluation is not complete by the sixth month, the examinee’s first sortie will be the
          evaluation. 413 FLTS aircrew requisites will be accomplished IAW the
          AFMC/AFSOC/AFRC MOA.
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.2. (AFMC) For initial qualification evaluations, requals, and initial instructor
       evaluations all requisites must be completed prior to the flight evaluation. Requisites for
       initial qualification, requalification, and initial instructor evaluations may be completed
       up to 5 months prior to the month of the evaluation. If the aircrew member has not
       completed IRC within the previous four quarters, the course must be completed prior to
       the flight portion of the AF Form 8 evaluation. Pilots qualifying in aircraft that require
       only one pilot must complete written qualification examinations before the first training
       flight without an IP in the aircraft. Complete all required requisites for both crew
       positions when completing combined evaluations.
          5.5.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Use these criteria for SPOT and No-Notice evaluations
          that will fulfill or reset the periodic eligibility requirements.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
44                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
  recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
  (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
     5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
     basis.
         5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
         IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
     5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
     period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
     training required.
     5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
     administer the recheck.
     5.6.1.3. (46TW) If an examinee fails an evaluation or requires additional training, the
     original flight examiner will not conduct the reevaluation or additional training unless
     approved by the Chief of OGV.
     5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
     Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
     5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
     recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
     evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
     5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
     remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
  5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
  evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
  mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
  the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
         opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
         specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
         similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
         all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
         5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                45


          5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
          qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
          supervised status for mission tasks.
          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.3. (AFMC) See AFI 11-2FT Vol 1 for guidance on removal of formal school
      evaluation restrictions.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s        may    extend
          evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
46                              AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


         IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
         supplements to this instruction.
         5.8.3.2.2. (AFMC) Submit case-by-case requests for an evaluation extension to
         AFMC/A3V using the AFMC Form 73. Extensions beyond three months will not
         normally be considered.
         5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
         of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
         IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
         paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
         longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
         see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
         period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
         5.8.3.2.3. (46TW) SQ/DOVs will complete a Squadron Commander Extended
         Flight Evaluation MFR via COOL IAW Attachment 8. When a successful evaluation
         is completed a statement will be included in the Additional Comments Section of the
         AF Form 8/8a, IAW AFI 11-202V2 explaining that an extension was granted and
         why.
             5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
             5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
             5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
             5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
             5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
             than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
             before or during deployment.
     5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
         5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
         authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
         5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
         administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
         attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
         supervisor.
         5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
         authority.
  5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
  period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
  member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
  5.6.3 apply.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  47


       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
5.10. (AFMC)Certification in MD variants (series or modified mission) does not constitute
multiple qualifications (i. e. F-15C and F-15E or C-130H and AC-130H).
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.2. (AFMC) Use the AF Form 4348 to document completion of conversion/difference
   training in these aircraft when a Form 8 evaluation is not required. In addition, units will
   document all aircraft in which training has been completed on the Letter of X.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
48                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  5.10.3. (AFMC) Document AFMC multiple qualifications on AFMC Form 80, Multiple
  Qualification Request and Authorization. Use the AFMC Form 80 to document military,
  government civilian, and contractor aircrew members that fly in support of AFMC flight
  operations. Use AFMC Form 80 for all pilot, RPA pilot, navigator, CSO, electronic warfare
  officer, fire control officer, flight engineer, loadmaster, and boom operator multiple
  qualification requests. Flight surgeons flying under an FS duty code do not require an AFMC
  Form 80. Any Flight Surgeon acting as a primary crew member (i.e. pilot, navigator, etc) will
  have an AFMC Form 80, coordinated and approved as detailed above. A Form 80 is not
  required for Non-rated aircrew multiple qualification documentation. AFMC Form 80 will
  be maintained in the first section of the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF).
     5.10.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Approval Authority. AFMC delegates approval authority for
     dual qualifications to the flying wing commander. Alternatively, AFMC/A3V is the
     approval authority for dual qualifications for aircrew who are assigned to an AFMC unit
     without a parent flying wing organization. AFMC/A3 is the approval authority for
     Center, wing and group commanders. AFMC/A3 is the approval authority for any other
     O-6 in a flying position. Submit the AFMC Form 80 for these individuals to AFMC/A3V
     for coordination and staffing to AFMC/A3. AFMC/A3 is the approval authority for all
     triple qualifications. Triple qualifications will only be authorized when there is a
     complete and compelling reason. The duration of the qualification will be a temporary
     solution to solve short term manning problems. The unit must submit justification in
     writing signed by the wing commander or equivalent. Submit the AFMC Form 80 and
     accompanying justification to AFMC/A3V for coordination and staffing to AFMC/A3.
     Forward copies of all AFMC Forms 80 to AFMC/A3V for command level program
     oversight.
     5.10.3.1. (46TW) The flying organization to which an aircrew member is assigned for
     flying purposes (including attached and contractor aircrew) will complete the AFMC
     Form 80 and forward it to OGV for coordination and processing. AFMC Form 80 for
     contractor aircrew will be sent to the Government Flight Representative (GFR) first and
     then to OGV. OGV will forward the AFMC Form 80 to the appropriate office for
     approval and then distribute the final approved/disapproved AFMC Form 80 to the
     requesting unit and copies to the GFR (as required).
     5.10.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Review and Reporting. Submit a complete listing of all pilot
     multiple qualifications to AFMC/A3V at the end of each half (31 Mar and 30 Sep) for
     compilation into the AFMC/A3V review. Additionally, each year in September, OG/CCs
     will review and re-validate all multiple qualifications. Cancel those no longer required for
     mission accomplishment. Document this review with initials and date on each AFMC
     Form 80. A new AFMC Form 80 is required when aircraft qualification is changed.
     Changes in aircrew duty position do not require annotation. Upon permanent change of
     station (PCS) of a multiple qualified aircrew, the AFMC Form 80 will be re-
     accomplished by the gaining unit if multiple qualifications are still required. AFMC
     Forms 80 approved at HQ AFMC will have a control number and expiration date. These
     blocks are optional for flying wing commander approved multiple qualifications.
     5.10.3.2. (46TW) Flying units will submit a list of all multiple qualified aircrew
     members assigned/attached to their organization along with the original AFMC Form 80
     to OGV by 31 August of each year. This list will recommend continuation or cancellation
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                 49


     of existing multiple qualifications for each aircrew. OGV will consolidate and forward all
     documentation to the OG/CC for review and notify units of any changes to multiple
     qualifications. An asterisk will be placed next to the appropriate aircraft on the AFMC
     Form 80 to designate the primary aircraft. Aircrew members who PCA and do not change
     OG/CCs are not required to initiate a new AFMC Form 80. If the PCA includes a change
     of flying organization to which a crew member is assigned/primarily attached, the
     gaining organization commander will review and annotate on the reverse side of the
     AFMC Form 80 "AFMC Form 80 reviewed and accepted," followed by date and
     signature.
     5.10.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Exceptions. Pilot and flight engineer qualification in B-
     707/E-3/E-8 variants are considered a single qualification upon completion of conversion
     training in each specified aircraft. Pilot qualification in B-747 variants (including AL-1)
     is considered a single qualification upon completion of conversion training in each
     specified aircraft. RPA pilot qualification in the MQ-1 and MQ-9 is considered a single
     qualification upon completion of conversion training in each aircraft. RPA (UAS Group
     4/5) companion trainers (if applicable) will be documented on an AFMC Forms 80;
     however, the companion trainer is not considered a ―second‖ or ―third‖ qualification in
     regards to approval authority. Non-USAF glider tow planes, and civil aviation (aero club)
     aircraft flown in conjunction with the United States Air Force Test Pilot School
     (USAFTPS) curriculum do not constitute a multiple qualification. Aircraft flown for non-
     DoD purposes (i.e. DoD contractor aircrew flying on non-DoD contract aircraft) do not
     constitute a multiple qualification. This exception does not constitute a multiple
     qualification; however, document all aircraft flown for professional reasons on an AFMC
     Form 80 (See DCMA Inst 8210.1 / AFI 10-220 for additional guidance). Qualifications in
     multiple variants of the same MD family do not constitute a multiple qualification. See
     AFI 11-2FT Vol 1, MDS Attachments for additional guidance.
     5.10.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Training. Do not begin qualification ground or flying
     training in an additional aircraft until the AFMC Form 80 has been approved. AFMC
     Form 80 approval does not negate or relieve any provisions of AFI 11-202V1 concerning
     aircraft qualification training. Do not enter flying personnel into qualification or re-
     qualification training in more than one aircraft at the same time.
     5.10.3.5. (Added-AFMC) OG/CCs will designate a primary aircraft for multiple
     qualified aircrews. AF Forms 8 for dual qualified pilots will be reviewed as directed in
     Table 5.1 (Added). The Final Approval Official will be the flying unit commander for
     the aircraft in which the eval was administered.
     5.10.3.5. (46TW) For multiple-qualified primary aircrew, the primary aircraft will be
     designated on the Letter of Xs. For MAs, the primary aircraft will be the first aircraft for
     which all requisites have been completed during initial qualification. The primary
     aircraft always determines the eligibility period for periodic evaluations. The primary
     aircraft for MAs may only change following periodic evaluations based on mission
     requirements and IAW para 7.3.5.4.4 of this supplement.

   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.4. (AFMC) Dual qualified pilots will complete an instrument evaluation in each
   category of aircraft in which qualified. See Table 5.1 (Added) Contact AFMC/A3V for any
   aircraft not listed.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.5. (AFMC) Different series aircraft in the same MD do not constitute multiple
   qualifications and therefore do not require separate QUAL evaluations.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                 51


minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (AFMC) Universal Qualification status is not applicable to AFMC operations.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.2. (AFMC) Submit request to AFMC/A3V for considerations and/or approval.
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
   5.12.4. (Added-AFMC) Exchange/Foreign Personnel. All primary aircrew will have a
   current AF Form 8 to fly in an unsupervised status. Commanders will approve and Chiefs of
   Stan/Eval will review each aircrew’s individualized training program to ensure adequate
   knowledge of and proficiency in USAF/AFMC procedures. Upon completion of training,
   conduct ground and flight evaluations (as required) and document on AF Forms 8 (Not
   applicable for USAF/TPS students).

5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.1. (AFMC) Initial Cadre status may be extended to any aircrew (rated, CEA, or non-
   rated). OG/CC will designate initial cadre crewmembers.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.3. (AFMC) The MFR will document training requirements (if any) associated with
   initial cadre status.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
   5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
   5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
   capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
   similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
   MDS Vol 2/MOU.

                                          Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.2. (AFMC)Scope This chapter also applies to non-rated (X-prefix), AFMC
assigned/attached Flight Surgeons, and all government civilians and contractors in like
aircrew positions.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. (AFMC) AFMC will use Center Operations On Line (COOL) as designated by
   AFMC/A3V.
   6.3.2. (46TW) Tests will be proctored via the COOL program. Open book and Instrument
   tests may be accomplished at any computer capable of connecting to COOL, and at the
   discretion of the examinee IAW para 6.3.1. For the closed book examination, ensure the
   examinee is supervised. 46 OG/OGV or 586 FLTS/DOV personnel are the preferred
   supervisors for the closed book exam. If such personnel are not available, they may delegate
   the responsibility to the squadron SELOs.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
   6.4.1. (46TW) All newly assigned rated aircrew, non-rated aircrew (Mission Aircrew), and
   Flight Surgeons must complete an open book local procedures exam and a marshaling exam
54                           AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  prior to their first flight. These exams will be proctored and maintained by 46 OG/OGV or
  586 FLTS. Unit go/no-go procedures will reflect the status of these exams.
     6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
     be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
     references for open book examinations.
     6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
     the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
     safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
     6.4.1.2. (46TW) Squadron MDS Chief pilots will review Secure Question Banks (SQB)
     and prepare MDS exams by the end of September every year or after any changes in the
     source documents. Send the updated question banks to 46 OG/OGV (586 FLTS/DOV for
     the 586th) after the review is complete. 46 OG/OGV and 586 FLTS/DOV will review
     marshalling, new aircrew, and instrument question banks by end of September every year
     or after any changes in the source documents. OGV will update the computer based
     testing program with the question bank. When applicable, review and updating can be
     done directly in COOL. Squadron MDS chief pilots will develop and maintain an open
     book SQB. OGV will review SQBs. This review may be delegated to SQ/DOV. The
     COOL database will be maintained based on these reviews to ensure accurate random
     tests of 50 questions are generated. Squadron MDS chief pilots are encouraged to
     maintain their SQBs directly in the COOL program.
     6.4.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Open book examinations will contain a minimum of 50
     questions, 10 of which will be derived from applicable USAF, AFMC, and local flight
     instructions. Examinations will be reviewed for accuracy upon change or revision to any
     referenced publication. Use of AFMC Form 70, Standardization/Evaluation Answer
     Sheet or equivalent can be used for any testing requirement.
     6.4.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Open book examinations are not required for non-rated (X-
     prefix) aircrew or Flight Surgeons, but may be prescribed at the unit level. Units will
     forward copies to AFMC/A3V for review.
     6.4.1.4. (46TW) Non-rated (X-prefix) aircrew and Flight Surgeons do not require an
     open book examination.
  6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
  6.4.2. (AFMC) Closed book examinations will be constructed from master question files
  and will measure knowledge of essential information critical to the safe and effective
  operation of the aircraft to include aircraft limitations, systems, normal and emergency
  procedures, cautions, warnings, and egress. Examinations will contain a minimum of 20
  questions and, when applicable, boldface/CAPS. Examinations will be reviewed for accuracy
  upon change or revision of any referenced publication.
     6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
     specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
     aircrew.
     6.4.2.1. (AFMC) Test questions should be multiple choice with only four possible
     answers (a,b,c,d). True/false questions may also be used. The MQFs will contain a
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                 55


      minimum of 100 questions taken from the flight manual. Non-rated aircrew (to include
      FS) MQFs will contain a minimum of 50 questions. These questions must be applicable
      to all users of the MDS. If unable to generate 50 questions, contact AFMC/A3V relief.
      An AFMC Form 73 waiver is not required for approval.
          6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
          administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
          procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
          6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
          Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
          necessary.
          6.4.2.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Similar Model/Design aircraft may have combined
          MQFs and tests to cover all series in that design. (i.e.F-16/A/C/CM). Crew members
          are responsible for only those questions that are specific to MDS variants for which
          they are qualified. These questions will be identified by category designation.
          6.4.2.1.4. (Added-AFMC) The key element of the MQF program is the CCP. CCPs
          will develop and maintain their respective MQFs tailoring each mission design series
          (MDS) and crew position to AFI 11-2FTV2. The MQF program will be posted on the
          AFMC CoP. In addition, each CCP will be responsible for updating their MQFs
          when changes to the Flight Manual occur.
              6.4.2.1.4.1. (Added-AFMC) CCPs will be tasked to update MQFs annually or
              when a change to the flight manual occurs.
              6.4.2.1.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Notify AFMC/A3V and the CCP upon the
              discovery of inaccurate or outdated information in command MQF files.
      6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
      MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
   Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
   procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
   test.
   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
   6.4.4. (46TW) Examinees will complete an Exam Discrepancy anytime they discover an
   inaccurate question or challenge a question from any requisite examination. OGV will review
   the discrepancy for validity, take action (if needed), notify the examinee of the outcome, and
   update scores (as required). Examination Discrepancy Sheets are located in the testing
   facility.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force    Education   and    Training   Course    Announcement     (ETCA)        database
 56                             AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  57


   6.8.4. (Added-46TW) All aircrew will notify OGV upon completion of a requisite test.
   OGV will ensure the proper score was recorded in COOL and address any disputed
   questions.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
6.9. (46TW)Failure of a requisite exam: will result in a grounded status. COOL will reflect a
―No Go‖ status for any failed exams. In addition, after a failed examination the testing official
will notify the aircrew member, the squadron operations officer, on-duty aviation resource
manager, and the squadron operations supervisor of aircrew’s grounded status. The testing
official will also advise upon successful subsequent completion of the exam. The minimum time
required for an ―adequate study period‖ will be at the discretion of the examinee.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
       6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
       exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
       6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
       resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
       aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
       results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
       instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
6.10. (AFMC)Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). Periodic testing content and frequency
is at the discretion of the unit, if used.
6.10. (46TW)Periodic testing: will consist of all aircrew (rated, non-rated, CEA and mission
support) completing a weekly boldface or critical action procedures test (if applicable) and a
weekly Master Question File (MQF) test for each aircraft in which they maintain currency.
Passing grades are 100% for Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPS) and 85% for weekly
tests. A passing grade will be obtained prior to flying. In addition, incorrect answers will be
reviewed prior to flying. Weekly COOL testing is normally used for this testing with a rolling 7-
day test date. Paper tests must be available in case COOL is unavailable, maintained by the
individual flying squadron. Flying TDY aircrew should be current in weekly testing upon
departing for the flying TDY but are not required to accomplish subsequent weekly testing until
 58                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


they return to home station. No makeup test is required for periods of absence such as leave,
non-flying TDY, etc. Additional periodic testing is at the discretion of the SQ/CC, SQ/DO and
OGV.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  59


                                           Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
   7.1.2. (AFMC) Electronic Forms 8/8a and all other contents of an electronic FEF will be
   maintained in COOL.
   7.1.2. (46TW) COOL Forms 8/8a will be used to the maximum extent possible. If the
   evaluator does not have access to COOL, paper/IMT versions of COOL will be accepted.
   This should be coordinated with OGV prior to the evaluation. The evaluator, reviewing
   officer, final approving officer, and examinee will sign a hard-copy of the AF Form 8/8a.
   OGV will then scan the final version into the electronic FEF in COOL. The paper copy will
   be maintained in OGV.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (AFMC)AFMC units and AFRC units under OPCON to AFMC will use the AF Form
4348 to document completion of conversion/difference training when a Form 8 evaluation is
not required. The Form 4348 is not required for qualifications documented on the Form 8a.
The Form 4348 is not required if only one variant of an MD exists (ie B-2A).
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
60                             AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


     7.3.1.2. (AFMC) The AF Form 8a will be used to document non-rated (X-prefix)
     aircrew and Flight Surgeon aircraft qualification. The Form 8a will not be used to
     document primary aircrew (rated and CEA) qualification in multiple aircraft.
     7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
     examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
  7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
  sample AF Forms 8a.
     7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
     the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
     7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
     (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
     7.3.2.3. The ―Eligibility Period‖ and ―Expiration Date of Qualification‖ blocks will use a
     three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
     7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
     ―INSTR‖), use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
     7.3.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Normally, the AF Form 8/8a is left ―open‖ until all flight
     evaluation and ground requisites are complete. When requisites are not completed within
     the prescribed period, close the AF Form 8. When a less than qualified grade is awarded
     on any requisite or evaluation or the examinee is placed in a supervised status, close the
     AF Form 8.
        7.3.3.3.1. (Added-46TW) For rated aircrew AF Form 8s, all requisites must be
        completed by the end of the fifth month for periodic evaluations. Failure to complete
        the requisites by the end of the fifth month will result in grounding of the aircrew
        pending completion of the requisites. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated
        with OGV.
        7.3.3.3.2. (Added-46TW) For non-rated aircrew initial qualifications, the AF Form
        8a will be closed immediately upon completion of the last requisite for that aircraft
        qualification. If this is the first INIT evaluation completed this establishes the
        primary aircraft and eligibility period for the evaluation and allows the aircrew to
        perform missions in that aircraft while continuing to complete requisites for follow-
        on aircraft. Once requisites are completed for follow-on aircraft, a new AF Form 8a
        will be completed, and the expiration date will be based upon the examinee’s primary
        aircraft. This does NOT establish a new eligibility period. Since the primary aircraft
        may be on a different AF Form 8a, Stan/Eval functions must be diligent in confirming
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  61


         proper expiration dates on AF Forms 8a.) The evaluation process will re-open with a
         new AF Form 8a as requisites for follow-on aircraft are completed IAW para
         7.3.5.2.1 (AFMC).
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.
     7.3.4.1. Name, Rank (USAF-standard abbreviated or non-abbreviated rank is acceptable)
     and last four of Social Security Number (SSN).

         (i.e. EPE).
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.2. (AFMC) Enter the aircraft MD in which the evaluation was given.
            7.3.4.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) For FS, the first entry will be ―ALL‖. Following
            entries will be the applicable aircraft MDs.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.
         7.3.4.3.4. (Added-AFMC) For aircrew maintaining qualification in more than one
         MD, list all MDs that the instrument evaluation applies to in the AF Form 8, Section
         D, Additional Comments.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation
         expires Sep 12, enter Apr-Sep 12).
         7.3.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for INIT, SPOT, RQ, and out-of-the-eligibility
         period evaluations (see paragraph 5.8.3.2).
         7.3.4.4.3. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.8.3.2.3, enter the
62                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


         6-month period preceding the original expiration date (SQ/CCs extend only the
         expiration date, not the eligibility period).
         7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 12 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 13, enter
         ―INSTM: Jun-Nov 12/QUAL: Aug 12-Jan 13‖ for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
  7.3.5. - Qualification.
     7.3.5.1. Ground Phase.
         7.3.5.1.1. Examination/Check.
            7.3.5.1.1.1. Make a separate entry for each ground requisite exam/evaluation.
            Discrepancies will be noted in the examiner’s remarks (see paragraph 7.3.7.3.3).
            7.3.5.1.1.1. (AFMC) The entry order will be as listed below. Crewmembers

            exam/evaluation by MDS IAW published guidance.
            7.3.5.1.1.7. (Form 8a) For a combined ground requisite that includes all
            applicable aircraft under Universal Qualification guidelines (example: one
            closed/open book examination which contains questions for more than one
            aircraft or one EPE which evaluates more than one aircraft) make a single line
            entry for each requisite (i.e. Open Book, Closed Book, EPE etc.).
        7.3.5.1.2. Date. In the date column, enter the date that the requisite is successfully
        completed. Enter the recheck (EPE)/reexam (test/Boldface/CAPs) date if a

            7.3.5.1.3.3. Separate Boldface/CAPs grades from other requisite examination
            grades when on the same line by enclosing them in parentheses as follows: 84/98
            (U/Q).
            7.3.5.1.3.4. Enter failed EPE grades with a successful recheck as follows: 3/1.
     7.3.5.2. Flight Phase.
        7.3.5.2.1. (Form 8a) If applicable governing instructions require non-rated aircrew
        to demonstrate in-flight proficiency in more than one MDS, MAJCOMs may use a
        separate AF Form 8a for each MDS with flight phase evaluations IAW multiple
        qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
        paragraph 5.11.
        7.3.5.2.1. (AFMC) A flight phase evaluation is not required for non-rated (X-prefix)
        or Flight Surgeons. Document local requirements in the unit supplement to this
        instruction.     All initial aircraft qualifications will be documented on
        separate/individual Form(s) 8a. Consolidate all Forms 8a into a single document
        during the next phase (recurring) period. Additional initial aircraft qualifications
        gained outside of the recurring Form 8a eligibility period may be documented on a
        separate Form 8a.
        7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
64                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


                INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
                7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
                8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
                (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
                7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
                instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
            7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
            on separate days.
            7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
            flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
            may be used.
        7.3.5.2.3. Date.
            7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
            7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
            over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
            flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
            7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
            spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a ―1‖ (for Q1) or ―2‖ (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        ―3‖ (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., ―INSTM: 1‖ and
            ―QUAL: 2‖ in the qualified block or ―INSTM/MSN: 1‖ in the qualified block and
            ―QUAL: 3‖ in the unqualified block).
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  65


       7.3.5.4.1. IAW paragraph 5.8.1. for evaluations that establish a new eligibility
       period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight
       phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
       7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter ―N/A.‖
       7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
       were successfully completed and/or ―N/A‖ if all parts were assigned an unqualified
       grade.
          7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
          completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
          assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
          ―N/A‖ for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
          INSTM 3, then enter ―QUAL-Jul 12‖ under Qualified and ―INSTM-N/A‖ under
          Unqualified).
       7.3.5.4.4. (Form 8a) For evaluations without a flight phase requirement that
       establish a new eligibility period enter the month and year that is 17 months after the
       month in which the latest ground requisite was successfully completed.
       7.3.5.4.4. (AFMC) For initial aircraft qualifications, the first (oldest) Forms 8a
       expiration date determines the expiration date for all subsequent initial Forms 8a
       qualifications. All additional aircraft will expire on the same date. Subsequent
       recurring evaluations (consolidated on a single Form 8a) will expire on the date of the
       last aircraft evaluation administered within the eligibility period.
       7.3.5.4.4. (46TW) For non-rated aircrew In the Eligibility Period (periodic)
       evaluations, the SQ/DOV will assess, in coordination with the examinee, which
       aircraft qualifications are still required. Unnecessary qualifications will be allowed to
       expire. SQ/DOV will create a AF Form 8a shell with only the required aircraft and
       the examinee may begin requisite completion. The AF Form 8a will remain open
       until all aircraft have been completed. At the end of the fifth month, any aircraft with
       incomplete requisites will be removed from the Form 8a and the form will be closed
       and routed for signatures. Once the AF Form 8a is closed, the aircrew loses
       qualification in any aircraft that has been removed from the form. Upon completion
       of the requisites, the aircraft qualification may be added IAW para 7.3.5.2.1,
       (AFMC). In the event that an initial qualification is taking place during the eligibility
       period of other periodic evaluations taking place, the last requisite of the first periodic
       evaluation completed will set the expiration for all aircraft including the initial
       evaluation being taken and will become the primary aircraft. To allow the
       evaluations to be certified within required timeframes, signatures on the back of the
       AF Form 8A will be electronically signed as those aircraft requisites are completed.
       The signatures on the front of the form (electronically signed in COOL) will be
       determined by the first aircraft (primary aircraft) completed.
       7.3.5.4.5. (Form 8a) For evaluations with a flight phase that establish a new
       eligibility period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which
       the flight phase evaluation was successfully completed.

            EPE or FLT, as appropriate.
        7.3.5.6.3. Certifying Official. The instructor who completed the additional training
        (or final event if more than one instructor is used) will sign as the Certifying Official.
     7.3.5.7. Restrictions/Exceptionally                       Qualified/Commander-Directed
     Downgrade. Place an ―X‖ in the appropriate block when comments are annotated in
     Section IV. Do not annotate for restrictions resulting from failed requisite exams.
        7.3.5.7.1. (Added-AFMC) Restrictions include items derived from poor
        performance on an evaluation and either become permanent or dropped when the
        prescribed Additional Training is completed. Also, include Phase I mission elements
        that weren’t completed in the training program. For example, if a pilot didn’t
        complete night training requirements in the Phase I training program. Restrictions
        may be permanent or may be temporary. Temporary restrictions such as night training
        not complete at the time of the evaluation may be lifted when the ADDITIONAL
        TRAINING block of the AF Form 8 is signed. Restrictions may include: Day only
        (TPS school instructors night restricted), CONUS only (for navigators not over water
        qualified).
        7.3.5.7.2. (Added-AFMC) Exceptionally Qualified. The aircrew member must
        score 100 on all required closed book examinations (MQF). All open book
        examinations must be graded 95 or higher. The EPE and BOLDFACE/CAPS (when
        applicable) must be graded Q/1 with no discrepancies.

  7.3.6. – Certification Signatures.
     7.3.6.1. Flight Examiner.
         7.3.6.1.1. (Form 8a) With only ground phase requisites required, any unit
         designated flight examiner can sign the AF Form 8a.
         7.3.6.1.2. The flight examiner signing Section III of the AF Form 8:
            7.3.6.1.2.1. Is responsible for the content of the AF Form 8/8a, and will not sign
            Section III until verifying all required items (IAW this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS
            Vol 2) are documented.
            7.3.6.1.2.2. Will always place an ―X‖ in the remarks block and make comments
            in the comments block
                7.3.6.1.2.2.1. (Form 8a) This applies only when a flight phase is required; if
                only a ground phase is required, do not place an "X" in the remarks block and
                no Examiner Remarks are required in the Comments block in Section IV.
         7.3.6.1.3. If two or more flights are required to complete an evaluation, only the
         flight examiner completing the evaluation will sign Section III, any other evaluator(s)
         will enter remarks in the Mission Description block describing those parts of the
         flight evaluation they evaluated and sign a signature block immediately adjacent to
         their remarks (see examples in Attachment 3).
         7.3.6.1.3. (AFMC) Each examiner will document as a minimum Examiner’s
         remarks, part A and B. The examiner’s signature block will reflect the examiner’s
         name, grade and organization.
     7.3.6.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers.
         7.3.6.2.1. (Form 8a) A Reviewing Officer is not required for non-rated aircrew with
         only ground phase examination requisites for qualification.
         7.3.6.2.1. (AFMC) A reviewing officer is required for AFMC operations.
         7.3.6.2.2. The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (those officers holding these
         positions, or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not
         necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8/8a
         and the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is
         adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an ―X‖ in
         the ―Concur‖ block.
            7.3.6.2.2.1. If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the Form
            8/8a, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting officer will place an
            ―X‖ in the ―Do Not Concur‖ block on his/her line of the AF Form 8/8a.
            7.3.6.2.2.2. If ―Do Not Concur‖ is marked, the non-concurring officer(s) will
            provide justification (e.g. reason for non-concurrence, suggested modifications to
            additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.
         7.3.6.2.3. The Reviewing Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the flight
         examiner, but prior to the Final Approval Officer.
 68                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


           7.3.6.2.4. The Final Approval Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the
           Reviewing Officer but prior to the examinee. As applicable, the Final Approving
           Officer may recommend or give a commander-directed downgrade IAW paragraph
           5.9 if further action is warranted.
           7.3.6.2.5. MAJCOMs will specify in the MAJCOM supplement who the reviewing
           and final approving officers will be for evaluations other than formal course
           evaluations accomplished at an FTU. The same individual will not sign as both the
           Reviewing and Final Approving Officer.
           7.3.6.2.5. (AFMC) The examiner, reviewer, and approving officer should all be
           different individuals for any particular AF Form 8. In addition to providing an
           additional level of command oversight, the Reviewing Officer is responsible for
           quality control of the AF Form 8/8a format and is also responsible for ensuring the
           content of the AF Form 8/8a is in compliance with this instruction and AFMC
           supplement. Therefore, the Reviewing Officer should be currently involved in the
           Stan/Eval operations of the unit; however, where the Unit Chief of Stan/Eval is the
           examinee or the examiner, the Final Approving Officer will designate an appropriate
           Reviewing Officer. The Final Approving Officer is responsible for certifying the
           qualifications attested to on the AF Form 8/8a and should be the flying unit
           commander or OG/CC. The next higher available level of flying oversight should
           approve flying unit commander evaluations. The levels of flying oversight are flying
           unit commander, operations group commander, wing commander, and finally
           AFMC/A3V. See Table 7.1 (Added) for additional guidance.
           7.3.6.2.5. (46TW) For 46 OG, OGV will perform duties as the reviewing officer for
           standardization with SQ/DOV performing an additional review. Reviewing duties
           can be delegated to SQ/DOV by OGV. For 413 FLTS personnel receiving
           evaluations from AFSOC, the reviewing and approving officials will be IAW AFSOC
           procedures and the AFMC/AFSOC/AFRC MOA.

            duties in an unsupervised status. Certification normally occurs on the date the
            final approving official signs the AF Form 8/8a. Approving officials may
            authorize unsupervised duty status prior to signature on the AF Form 8/8a.
            Document this authorization (with date) in the remarks section of the evaluation
            worksheet and the final AF Form 8, Section D, Additional Comments.
            7.3.6.2.5.1. (46TW) If necessary, the examinee may be authorized unsupervised
            duty prior to final signature of the evaluation. This must be coordinated with the
            Final Approving Officer, and the evaluator or SELO will document unsupervised
            duty status on the evaluation work sheet IAW the AFMC supplement. Under this
            exception, a paper copy of the evaluation worksheet, signed by the final
            approving officer, will be maintained by the SELO until the AF Form 8/8a has
            completed the signature process.
        7.3.6.2.6. For evaluations completed at formal course FTU locations, the reviewing
        and final approving officers will be assigned to the FTU.

        aircraft qualifications (recurring) on Section IV, Comments as shown in Attachment
        4. The flight examiner for the last aircraft will sign the front of the Form 8a. Signing
        the front closes the recurring Form 8a and initiates routing for Reviewing Officer and
        Final Approving Officer signatures.
        7.3.6.3.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers. Annotate unit/organization
        and office symbol as directed by MAJCOM supplement (e.g., 93 BS/DO, 388
        OG/CC, 4 FW/CC).
     7.3.6.4. Examinee. The examinee will sign and date after the Final Approving Officer
     certifying that they have been debriefed and understand the action(s) being taken.

     draft AF Form 8/8a.
     7.3.8.1. (46TW) Flight examiners will use the COOL worksheet templates to format
     mission descriptions and to complete temporary AF Forms 8/8a. The evaluation
     requirements in COOL (Sections A through F, as required) will be completed
     immediately by the evaluator following completion of an EPE, Egress practical, or flight
     phase of the evaluation. Any discrepancies between the COOL worksheets and the
     worksheets on the AFMC website must be reported to OGV immediately for correction.
     7.3.8.2. The temporary evaluation documentation will include examinee, examiner, type
     evaluation, qualification level, requisites results, and date completed. List any
     discrepancies by area/subarea, any restrictions, any additional training and any additional

     as soon as possible following the flight evaluation (Egress practical for MA). To manage
     quality control, prior to signing the AF Form 8, the examiner will inform the squadron
     SELO either via phone, in person, or by e-mail that the AF Form 8/8a has been
     accomplished and is awaiting review. Once the SELO has proofed the AF Form 8/8a via
     COOL, it will be treated as a temp Form 8. Once the final approving officer has signed
     the AF Form 8/8a in COOL, the examinee is cleared to perform unsupervised duties. If
     the COOL process is unavailable, complete a paper AF Form 8/8a and seek guidance
     from OGV.
     7.3.8.3. The examiner completing the evaluation will sign and date the temporary
     evaluation documentation.
     7.3.8.3. (46TW) If the examinee is to be cleared for unsupervised duties prior to final

     unsupervised duties IAW AFI 11-202v2, AFMC Sup.                         Date: _______‖
     Evaluators/SELOs will then print the AFMC Form 59, Aircrew Evaluation, and the
     evaluator and Final approving official will sign the form and send a copy to OGV. This
     will serve as a temporary AF Form 8 until the final version is processed and signed.
     7.3.8.4. Remove temporary evaluation documentation when the permanent AF Form
     8/8a is filed in the FEF.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                 73

        phase evaluation, Requisite completion dates from the Q3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
        annotated on the recheck form unless requisites were not completed or are required to
        complete the recheck.
        7.3.9.1.3. If the flight recheck is completed prior to completion of required requisites,
        delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until requisites are complete and enter the

7.6. (AFMC)Used to document completion of Aircraft Conversion/Difference training of
primary (rated and CEA) aircrew for all AFMC units and AFRC units under AFMC
OPCON. The Form 4348 is not applicable to non-rated (X-prefix) or Flight Surgeons.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
   7.6.1. (AFMC) List each variant (MDS) for which conversion/difference training has been
   completed. See example in Attachment 7. File the Form 4348 in the FEF.
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
      7.6.1.1. (AFMC) Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 for each MD qualified in. A
      separate line entry for each MDS variant, though not required is desired, and may be of
      benefit in the event of decertification. An AF Form 4348 is not required for aircraft for
      which there is only one MDS (ie B-52H or F-22A)
      7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
      member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
      unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
      7.6.1.3. (AFMC) The MDS variants documented on the Acceptance of Qualification
      Letter will be listed on the Form 4348 as ―Previous Qual‖. Subsequent certifications will
      be annotated in chronological order. See example in Attachment 7.
      7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
      SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
      transcriptions are accurate.
      7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
      directed by MAJCOM.
      7.6.1.5. (AFMC) The AF Form 4348 will only be used to document aircraft
      qualifications. All other training documentation will use the AF Form 1381 and will be
      filed in the individuals training folder.
      7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
      entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.
   7.6.2. General Data Entry.
      7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
      initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
      for flying) organization/location.

     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification in chronological order based on the date the action is
     completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 4348, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format, or as required for electronic forms.
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. Certified Event Title. Enter each certification title on the top block on the AF
     Form 4348.
     7.6.3.1. (AFMC) Enter the MDS variant.
     7.6.3.2. Enter the instructor’s rank, name and organization who completed applicable
     training for the certified event below the event title of the Certified Event block for the
     MDS under which the certification is given.
     7.6.3.2. (AFMC) Enter ―Previous Qual‖ in the instructor block as applicable. Aircraft
     qualification  gained    from     conversion/difference   training   will    annotate
     ―Conversion/Difference Training‖ in the remarks section.

     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.5. (AFMC) AF Form 4348 certifying officials will be unit operations officers or
     higher (commander, etc)
     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                79

     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―Renamed (new
         title)‖ under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
     7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
     section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
         7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
         certifying official.
         7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
         proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
         generated AF Form 4348.
  7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
  certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
  certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
  are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
 80                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


   Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
   signify transcription accuracy.
   7.6.7. (AFMC) Unit supplements will list the certifications (MDS variants) to be
   documented as well as unit certifying officials (see para 7.6.3.5). Document all Phase I
   training (aircraft conversion/difference training) completions on the Form 4348. If the
   recurring flight evaluation can be completed on any MDS variant, also list the Form 8
   certified variant on the Form 4348.
   7.6.7. (46TW) No additional certifications other than conversion/difference training will be
   documented on the AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. Use the AF Form 1381,
   USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, IAW para 7.6.1.5 in the individual training folder
   for all other certifications/qualifications. Squadron operating instructions will ensure that
   ARMS certifications match those documented on the AF Form 4348. Additionally, if the
   SQ/CC authorizes someone other than the Chief of OGV and/or SQ/DOV to sign the last line
   of an AF Form 4348, that authorization will be documented in an appointment letter and
   maintained in the squadron. OGV will also be informed of this authorization.

     7.8.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
     the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
  7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
     7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
     into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
     maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
     7.8.2.1. (46TW) Hard copy FEFs received by OGV during an individual’s in-processing
     will be maintained in OGV. The historical contents of the FEF will be scanned into
     COOL. A separate file will be created for Section I and Section II, respectively. Both
     files will be uploaded into Section I, Other Documents.
     7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,

                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.
  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.

     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.8.4.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the ―For Official Use Only‖ label/stamp on both sides of the
     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
     7.8.5.1. (46TW) Initial Reviews: Once the electronic FEF has been created in COOL,
     ensure historical information is loaded into Section I (i.e. scanned copies of current AF
     Forms 8/8a, current/accepted qualifications on the AF Form 4348, etc.) are included in
     the electronic FEF. Documentation from a hard-copy FEF will be archived and retained
     by 46 OG/OGV until the member PCSs, retires, or separates. The initial review will then
     be documented in COOL on the AF Form 942. If the individual has PCS’d from another
     AFMC unit follow the procedures for an Annual Review by selecting the ―Reviewed‖
     button on the AF Form 942 page in the individual’s electronic FEF. Note: this may
     documented by COOL as an ―Annual Review.‖ If the individual is PCS/PCAing from
     another MAJCOM, documentation of the initial review is fulfilled by the change of
     MAJCOM annotated by para 7.7.6 of this supplement.
84                           AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
        7.8.5.2.4. (AFMC) Document procedures for the posting                review    in   unit
        supplements. This review may be accomplished electronically.
        7.8.5.2.4. (46TW) Document annual FEF reviews on the AF Form 942. Posting
        reviews will be conducted electronically when practical. If a hard-copy and/or non-
        COOL (i.e. IMT Forms) AF Form 8/8a is required, the document will be routed in-
        turn from the examiner, to the SELO, to the Reviewing Officer, and to the Final
        Approving Officer. If required, additional reviewers will sign prior to the Reviewing
        Officer. Hard-copy AF Forms 8/8a will require a manual entry into the AF Form
        942. The signed hard-copy/IMT form will then be uploaded into COOL and attached
        to the respective AF Form 942 entry for the examination. No additional
        documentation for the posting review is required.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.2. (AFMC) The interval between reviews will not exceed one year.
        Document the annual review by annotating ―ANNUAL REVIEW‖ in the Type of
        Evaluation and Date Completed.
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                85


        7.8.5.3.2. (46TW) Annual Reviews will be accomplished in COOL. SQ/DOV with
        OGV’s assistance is responsible for tracking and ensuring FEF reviews are
        accomplished within required timeframes. When the review is complete, select the
        ―Reviewed‖ button on the AF Form 942 page in the COOL FEF. This will document
        the annual review on the AF Form 942 IAW this instruction and the AFMC
        Supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
        7.8.6.2.1. (46TW) Major/Minor discrepancies will be documented via memorandum
        for record placed in Section I of the FEF and uploaded into ―Other Documents.‖
        Major discrepancy MFRs will use the outline provided in attachment 8.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
        7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
        without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
        contents of the FEF.
        7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
        white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
        official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
        corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
86                             AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


         7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
         allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
         and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.1. (46TW) A copy of the individual’s FEF will be maintained by OGV for 45 days
     following PCS. Individuals planning on in-processing with the gaining unit later than 45
     days should coordinate with OGV prior to departure.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
         7.8.7.3.3. (AFMC) Individuals PCSing within AFMC may transfer the FEF

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
8.1. (AFMC)Specialized Aircrew procedures are not applicable to AFMC non-rated (X-
prefix) aircrew.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
8.2. (46TW)Flight Surgeons: will accomplish the same egress checkride as non-rated aircrew.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.1. (AFMC) Flight Surgeons (assigned/attached/other MAJCOMs) flying with AFMC
   flight organizations will complete an MDS specific examination for each aircraft flown. See
   Chap 7 for documentation requirements using the AF Form 8a.
   8.2.1. (46TW) This exam will be the non-rated aircrew exam, and results will be tracked
   like all other aircrew.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  93


           9.1.5.4.3. Documents in the FCIF library will be made available for deployments via
           either electronic or hardcopy means.
9.2. Flight Related SII.
   9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis relating to existing procedure(s) designed to
   mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends.
       9.2.1.1. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures (reference guidance on
       issuing FCIFs in paragraph 9.1, above).
       9.2.1.2. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to
       include Safety Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related
       incidences, trend analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with
       equipment/procedures.
   9.2.2. SII(s) will be issued through the same process used to release FCIFs with the
   following elements:
       9.2.2.1. Specific MDS applicability
       9.2.2.2. References (document, SIB, etc)
       9.2.2.3. Risk factors and trend details
       9.2.2.4. Specific emphasis actions to reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that generated the
       SII.
       9.2.2.5. Effective date of rescission
       9.2.2.6. SME/POC for further information
   9.2.3. SII(s) will be of limited duration (generally not to exceed 90 days).
   9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
   from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
   units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
   SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
   within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
   9.2.5. Units will place all applicable SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part B, for
   dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.6. All current MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed during flight
   briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission-specific SII(s) need only be briefed on those
   missions for which the SII is relevant.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight. Units will
provide guidance on this system in the unit supplement.
9.3. (46TW)All rated and non-rated aircrew: are responsible for ensuring their own FCIF
status is "green" before each flight (to include off-station sorties). This may be accomplished by
a call to the squadron’s operations desk prior to flight or other method deemed suitable by the
Squadron DO. Prior to beginning the current day flight duties, operations supervisors will verify
 94                            AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


flyers have completed GO/NO GO procedures and notify anyone not yet cleared to fly prior to
their brief time.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
       9.3.1.1. Form 8/8a qualification or appropriate ARMS products.
       9.3.1.2. Ground and flight currency items required for flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
       AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, and AFI 11-421 Aviation Resource Management.
       9.3.1.3. Examination items required for flight from this AFI and applicable supplements
       (see Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.4. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       9.3.1.5. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B) items.
   9.3.2. (Added-46TW) Squadron DOs are responsible for ensuring accurate go/no-go status
   can be determined if electronic go/no-go media becomes inaccessible. Flying units will
   establish procedures to monitor currency expiration (or pending expiration) and ensure this
   information is brought to the attention of the individual and unit supervisors in a timely
   manner. (Note: COOL satisfies this requirement.) The last step in the GO/NO-GO process is
   for operations supervision personnel to verify completion of all GO/NO-GO items. This
   includes all assigned, attached, and guest aircrew, flight surgeons, non-rated aircrew, and
   operational support flyers, as well as other personnel such as MESP, MEGP, and incentive
   flyers. Some personnel may not have periodic testing or FCIF currency requirements. In this
   case, verifying their GO/NO-GO items may simply involve making sure their egress training,
   physical exam, and other paperwork required for them to fly is complete.
9.4. Supplementary Evaluations.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander
   to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
   9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
   9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
   evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
   evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
   supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
   9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
   result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
   9.4.6. At a minimum, supplementary evaluations results will be documented in SEB minutes
   (see Attachment 2).
9.5. Forms Adopted. AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012                                                  95


Flying or Special Operational Duty, AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment
Report, AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
9.5. (AFMC)AFMC Form 73, AFMC Flight Operations Waiver Request.
9.6. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification; AF Form 8a,
Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft); AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation; AF
Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications.
9.6. (AFMC)AFMC Form 50, Flight Crew Information File, AFMC Form 59, Aircrew
Flight Evaluation Sheet; AFMC Form 70, Standardization/Evaluation Answer Sheet; AFMC
Form 72, SEFE Objectivity Evaluation Sheet. AFMC Form 80, Multiple Qualification Request
and Authorization; AFMC Form 84, Flight Crew Information File Certification.
9.7. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Form 84, Flight Crew Information File Certification. The
AFMC Form 84 (or suitable alternate to include COOL) will be used to document FCIF
certification by primary assigned and attached aircrew personnel. Units will develop a Go/No-Go
process to ensure aircrews have completed all applicable requirements prior to flight. Primary
aircrew must review the FCIF prior to their first flight and then at least once annually. The
AFMC Forms 84 need not be maintained for mission support aircrew.
9.7. (46TW)COOL: will be used to document FCIF certification and weekly test completion.
COOL will provide annual FCIF reviews based on the FCIF release/review date.
   9.7.1. (Added-AFMC) FCIF notices may be issued by AFMC/A3V, Operations Group
   OGV, Chiefs of Stan/Eval or unit SELOs. FCIF items include information that applies to
   current ground/flight operations. The issuing authority establishes an expiration date for each
   FCIF item. FCIF items of a permanent nature need no expiration date, but should be
   incorporated into local directives when practical. FCIF monitors will conduct a review every
   90 days to ensure currency of the file and to remove expired notices. Retain removed notices
   in a dead file for a period of 120 days. Use AFMC Form 50, Flight Crew Information File as
   a transmittal sheet for all FCIF entries. If COOL is used to generate FCIFs at the Group or
   lower level, the Form 50 is not required. Each level of Stan/Eval will develop a local control
   numbering system and distribute to appropriate units. The FCIF will be posted no later than
   the following morning after receipt.
   9.7.1. (46TW) COOL automatically assigns the next number to new FCIFs. 46 OG/OGV
   and 586 FLTS/DOV are designated FCIF monitors. OGV may delegate this responsibility to
   the unit SELOs if required due to limited resources.
       9.7.1.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC FCIFs can be retrieved in digital Format from the
       AFMC CoP.
   9.7.2. (Added-AFMC) If used, Forms 84 annual reviews are annotated on the top section of
   the Form. Indicate FCIF currency for guest aircrews on the flight authorization AF Form
   4327 or AF Form 4327a, as applicable, with FCIF number and initials next to the crew
   member’s name. Old cards must be kept for 1 year. Electronically kept versions should be
   readily available through a medium that allows for reliable easy access to aircrews and unit
   supervision. The unit will prescribe backup procedures to the electronic data.
   9.7.2. (46TW) The 46 TW will use COOL to track FCIF signatures and annual reviews. If
   COOL is unavailable, the current FCIF will be annotated on the AF Form 4327, ARMS
96                             AFI11-202V2_AFMCSUP_46TWSUP_I 31 JANUARY 2012


  Flight Authorization or AF Form 4327a, Crew Flight Authorization, as applicable, with
  initials next to the crew member’s name. COOL will be updated as soon as possible.
  9.7.3. (Added-AFMC) Units will establish procedures to ensure FCIF currency for aircrews
  operating away from home station.
  9.7.3. (46TW) If circumstances allow, off-station aircrew will use COOL to update FCIFs,
  Boldface/Tests, and review currencies. All aircrews operating away from home station are
  responsible for contacting the operations supervisor or DO to ensure they are FCIF-current
  and will be notified of any safety-critical FCIFs prior to flight (regardless of accessibility to
  COOL). Once the deployed aircrew is briefed on any new FCIFs, the operations supervisor
  will ensure the aircrew member’s FCIF status is updated.
  9.7.4. (Added-AFMC) Aircraft commanders are responsible for ensuring FCIF currency
  for all crewmembers, to include mission crew.
