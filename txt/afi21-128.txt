This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment Maintenance. It prescribes the
roles, responsibilities and processes used to manage the Air Force Reserve (AFR) Depot Maintenance
(DM) Program. Send any comments or suggested improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for

Washington DC 20330-1150. This publication does NOT apply to the Air National Guard (ANG).



1. General. The goal of the AFR DM Program is to assure quality aircraft and equipment that are com-
bat capable and ready for sustained military operations.

2. Purpose. The AFR DM Program provides an effective, cost efficient, combat ready capability by
maintaining and repairing existing systems. The Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance (DPEM)
requirements include aircraft, engines, other major end items, exchangeables, area support, base support,
local manufacture and aircraft storage. Contractor logistics support and sustaining engineering are also
included in the DM program.

3. Program functions. The Air Force Reserve O&M Appropriation is 3740. These funds support AFR
DM requirements which are validated and approved through the Program Objective Memorandum
(POM), Budget Estimate Submission (BES), and President’s Budget (PB). Other supporting processes
include the Maintenance Requirements Review Board (MRRB), the Logistics Support Review (LSR) and
the AFR DM Board. These processes provide orderly development, review and approval of depot main-
tenance needs and intervals for Air Force Reserve aircraft and engines.

4. Process. This process begins with identifying and programming resources sufficient to maintain the
highest possible combat readiness of AFR aircraft and equipment possible. It continually evaluates and
redirects planning, programming, budgeting, and execution of DM funds. The following steps ensure
success:
   4.1. The initial Depot requirements are determined by the Air Logistics Centers based on force struc-
   ture, engineering requirements, flying hours and historical data.
   The AFMC System Program Directors (SPD) outline the general technical requirements for their
   respective systems. The AFR program is refined and developed using the overall AF program with
   tailored requirements as identified by the AFRES weapon system manager through the AFRES DM
   program manager.
   4.2. The MRRB reviews and validates aircraft technical requirements for the current and future fiscal
   years.
   4.3. The AFR DM Board process supports the AFR POM and Financial Plan submissions.

5. Responsibilities:
   5.1. AF/REX:
       5.1.1. Assists USAF in the integration of AFR and AF requirements and is responsible for plan-

       program through the service POM and budget process. REX then provides approved program
       direction and monitors execution.
       5.1.3. Advise AF/RE in formulating equipment maintenance program policy.

   annual financial plan in May. AFRES/FM will work with AFRES/LG to provide prior year actual
   expenditures, estimated current year ending position, and a forecast of what is required for the budget
   year. This information will be presented by weapon system, program element and element of
   expense, with detailed explanations of the differences in dollar amounts between years. In addition,
   REC will request AF/REX to submit OP-30 and OP-80 exhibits. These exhibits will include
   non-financial data as well as backlog data and will require outyear data beyond the budget year.
       5.2.1. AF/REC will:
       5.2.2. Send a call for the financial plan to AFRES/FM in February.



                                                2

       established policies, procedures and responsibilities.
       5.3.1.2. Program resources required to perform equipment maintenance and to meet readiness
       and sustainability objectives. Request and justify additional resources or negotiate with
       AFMC or other supporting command for depot level support when shortfalls exist.
       5.3.1.3. Develop and submit draft OP-30 and OP-80 inputs to AF/REX to support budget sub-
       mission requirements.
       5.3.1.4. Develop POM submission for AFRES/XP.

           used to assure a quality process.

7. Metrics: AFRES/LGQ will provide DM execution metrics to the Program Monitor on a regular
basis. This will insure all parties: (process owners, customers, and suppliers work) from a common data
base. The type and frequency of measures will be approved by the Board.
