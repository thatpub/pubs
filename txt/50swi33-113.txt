1. Introduction.
     1.1. Scope. This instruction deals with facility preparation, cable installation and
     modification, H/W installation, and modifications to the SAFB Configuration Baseline for
     communications. A modification is defined as any change which departs from a description
     in approved documentation including changes to any depiction in engineering drawings,
     wiring lists, cable lists, floor plans and/or installation instructions. By implementing the 50
     SW Form 19, Installation/Modification Authorization Request (I/MAR) process and SAFB
     Scheduling process, SAFB is assured that all on-site installations/modifications to the SAFB
     Configuration Baseline for those areas under Configuration Management (see 50 SWI 33-
     105, C4 Systems Installation Standard) are properly coordinated, approved, scheduled,
     monitored, and documented.
     1.2. General. If a question arises whether a 50 SW Form 19 (hereafter referred to as Form
     19) is required, please contact the I/MAR Help Desk for assistance. If required the
     requesting organization shall meet with their CML or designee to determine requirements for
     the Form 19.
        1.2.1. A Form 19 is required for:
            1.2.1.1. All installations or modifications to the SAFB Configuration Baseline
            (facility, H/W, or documentation).
            1.2.1.2. All installations/modifications that interface with or that may change/alter
            interfaces with the SAFB Configuration Baseline.
        1.2.2. A Form 19 is not required for installation or modification of the software (S/W)
        baseline. However, all S/W installations or modifications that require utility outages or
        Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) downtime must be scheduled through
        SAFB Scheduling and coordinated with 22 SOPS/MAO.
2. 50 SW Form 19 Process/Preparation:
     2.1. The requesting organization is encouraged to meet with the Configuration Management
     Office or their designees to discuss the installation/modification requirements prior to the
     submission of a Form 19 package. The CML or their designee will assist the requesting
     organization in preparing the Form 19 and associated Technical Data Package if required.
        2.2.1. The Form 19 package shall incorporate and/or reference the detailed instructions
        for installation of the proposed work.
        2.2.2. When the Form 19 involves signal cable installation, including growth or spare
        cables, cable management data as described in 50 SWI 33-114, Cable Management, shall
        be included in the Form 19 package.
        2.2.3. When the installation/modification involves equipment/rack installation or power
        requirements, a 50 SW Form 20, Reservation/Removal Request Form, shall be submitted
        to the Configuration Management Office for floor space/rack space allocation and/or
        circuit assignments per 50 SWI 33-105.
        2.2.4. A copy of the approved 50 SW Form 20 must be included in the Form 19 package.
