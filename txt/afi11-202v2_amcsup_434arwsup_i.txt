        the pyramid level, then the next higher level is responsible. The senior evaluators for
        specific aircraft and missions receive evaluations from any appropriately qualified
        examiners when there are no qualified examiners in the pyramid above them.
        2.4.2.6.2. (Added-AMC) When an examiner other than an HQ/A3V examiner
        administers a pyramid evaluation, the examiner will annotate in the remarks section
        of the AF Form 8 that the evaluation satisfies the requirement of the pyramid
        evaluation per prior coordination with AMC/A3V. The remarks will include the
        names of the HHQ examiners (as applicable) with whom coordination was
        accomplished. i.e. ―Per coordination with SMSgt John Doe, 22AF/, CMSgt Bob
        Jones, AFRC/A3V, and Lt Col Phil Smith, AMC/A3V, this evaluation satisfies the
        requirement for a pyramid evaluation.‖ EXCEPTION: Pyramid evaluation is not
        required for aircrew undergoing aircraft conversion, difference training on aircraft or
        for students completing formal qualification and training programs according to AFI
        11-2MDS-Specific Vol 1.
        2.4.2.6.3. (Added-AMC) Units may align Stan/Eval crewmembers’ qualification
        expiration dates to allow all crew positions eligible for their pyramid evaluations to
        complete the check-ride at the same time.
        2.4.2.6.4. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V may perform a staff assistance visit (SAV) in
        conjunction with pyramid evaluations when specifically requested by the unit.
     2.4.2.7. Observe execution of unit missions and provide feedback when feasible.
     2.4.2.7. (AMC) At the direction of the AFRC NAF/A3, NAF/A3V personnel may
     observe AFRC unit missions and provide feedback to AFRC NAF/A3 or AMC/A3V, as
     appropriate. Spot and N/N evaluations may be administered. Comply with the
     requirements of paragraph 2.3.2.12 (Added).
     2.4.2.8. Review and coordinate on subordinate unit supplements to this instruction.
     2.4.2.8. (AMC) AFRC NAF/A3V will coordinate on unit local supplements and
     forward for approval to AFRC/A3V. Info copy the approved supplement to AMC/A3V.
     2.4.2.9. Review subordinate unit Stan/Eval Board (SEB) minutes and, at a minimum,
     address any action items requiring HHQ assistance.
     2.4.2.9. (AMC) AFRC NAF/A3V will address ARC specific issues in subordinate units.
     2.4.2.10. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V will consolidate and analyze data from aircrew
     trends by MDS, crew position, and AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet, area
     for consideration to be incorporated in the command’s aircrew SII Program. NOTE: This
     reporting requirement is exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324, The
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                  15


       Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal,
       Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.
   2.4.3. Organization. Typical NAF Stan/Eval staff includes a chief and one flight examiner
   per crew position per MDS. Manning may be adjusted by the NAF Commander.
       2.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) AFRC/NAF flight examiners will maintain flying proficiency
       (evaluator status) and should maintain full mission ready status. They should also be
       qualified or certified in as many special missions as possible. Special missions include
       receiver air refueling (AR), airdrop, joint precision airdrop system (JPADS), special
       operations air refueling (SOAR), etc. HQ AMC/HQ AFRC flight examiners are not
       required to maintain special mission currency according to AFI 11-202, Vol 1, Aircrew
       Training, and the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol 1; but they should have initial
       qualification in the specific special mission and participate as an examiner or observer on
       at least one special mission every 6-months.
   2.4.4. Augmentation. Each NAF may use qualified augmentees to support or conduct
   reviews, evaluations, and inspections with concurrence of all the NAF Stan/Eval
   organizations involved.
2.5. Stan/Eval Visits (SEVs). HHQ Stan/Eval staffs may visit units during the administration
of formal inspections (e.g. Unit Compliance Inspections), Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs), or in
an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM supplements.
   2.5.1. (Added-AMC) Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Visit (ASEV):
       2.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Purpose. ASEVs are the principal tool for evaluating aircrew
       flight operations and verifying safe and effective mission accomplishment. This is
       achieved through aircrew testing and flight evaluations to ensure compliance with
       approved operational procedures and applicable special interest items. Additionally, the
       effectiveness of unit aircrew Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and Aviation Resource
       Management programs are evaluated to ensure compliance and standardization among
       flying units, and provide feedback to unit commanders.
          2.5.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC ASEV teams may request augmentation from
          units or user-commands. The AFRC NAF/A3Vs should augment teams for ASEV on
          their respective AFRC units, and may be asked to augment any ASEV team. AFRC
          augmentee support will be coordinated through HQ AFRC/A3V.
       2.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) ASEV Testing. ASEV team will administer a closed book and
       Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination to all available personnel, in
       the grade of O-5 and below, who are qualified to fly unsupervised in unit aircraft. Test
       individuals who are dual MDS aircraft qualified in only their primary aircraft. The ASEV
       examinations may be used to satisfy recurring closed book testing requirements for flight
       evaluations.
          2.5.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Tests will be derived from a minimum of 85%
          MQF questions, with the balance coming from Flight Publications,
          Safety/Operational Supplements, FCIFs, and local directives.
          2.5.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) The minimum passing grade for an ASEV closed book
          exam is 85%. Boldface/CAPs exams are graded Q or U. Satisfactory performance
16                           AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


        requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence. Any crewmember failing
        an ASEV closed book test or Boldface/CAPs test will be placed in supervised status
        until successful completion of the unit closed book exam or Boldface/CAPs exam.
        2.5.1.2.3. (Added-AMC) The ASEV team will report the names of individuals
        tested and their scores to the unit commander. The final ASEV report will list the
        average of test scores by crew position and the overall average test score.
        2.5.1.2.4. (Added-AMC) If it is impractical for the unit to complete ASEV testing
        prior to the end of the ASEV, the ASEV team chief, in coordination with the unit,
        may elect to send representatives to the unit to administer some or all ASEV testing
        after formal ASEV notification but before arrival of the ASEV team. In rare cases,
        AMC/A3V may identify a ―trusted agent‖ to control the ASEV test content and
        conduct unit testing, or as specified by ASEV team chief.
     2.5.1.3. (Added-AMC) ASEV Flight Evaluations. Normally, 5%-25% of each crew
     position will be administered ASEV flight evaluations. This number is dependent upon
     the total number of N/N evaluations conducted on unit personnel between unit ASEVs.
     HQ AMC/A3V N/N goal is 20% of unit personnel per crew position between unit
     ASEVs. N/N evaluations outside of the ASEV window can be credited toward Squadron
     goals. Credit may be taken for ASEV evaluations administered by HQ AMC flight
     examiners within 90 days of the designated start date of the ASEV (the 90-day window
     may be extended by AMC/A3V to meet unit ASEV flight evaluation requirements). The
     total number of evaluations will be announced to the unit at the beginning of the ASEV
     window. EXCEPTION: ASEV Team Chief may elect to add or subtract from the total
     number of evaluations required.
        2.5.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC flight examiners will administer in-flight
        evaluations to senior OG (or equivalent) Stan/Eval personnel for each of the unit's
        assigned mission or design aircraft.
            2.5.1.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) Do not extend the senior Stan/Eval crewmember's
            evaluation expiration date to allow evaluation during the ASEV.
            2.5.1.3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Pyramid evaluations received within 6 months
            before the start of an ASEV will count towards the ASEV in-flight evaluation
            requirements.
        2.5.1.3.2. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC flight examiners will administer flight
        evaluations to instructors (preferably performing instructor duties) or flight examiners
        (preferably performing flight examiner or instructor duties).
        2.5.1.3.3. (Added-AMC) ASEV Simulator Evaluations. HQ AMC flight examiners
        may evaluate crew members in the applicable training device (if available). The
        evaluation will include all activity required for a Simulator evaluation.
        2.5.1.3.4. (Added-AMC) For KC-10 senior boom operator (squadron Chief Boom
        Operators), use Boom Operator Trainer (SIM/BOT). In addition, a KC-10 Formal
        Training Unit (FTU) instructor crew will be administered a SIM/BOT evaluation.
        Credit each SIM/BOT evaluation for one flight evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                               17


     2.5.1.4. (Added-AMC) Complete an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification,
     for all ASEV evaluations.
     2.5.1.5. (Added-AMC) ASEV Requirements:
        2.5.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Scheduling/Notification. AMC ASEV teams will
        visit units approximately every 40 months for unit-equipped active duty units and
        approximately every 60 months for unit-equipped ANG and AFRC units. Associate
        unit (active duty and ARC) visits will be the same frequency (and usually concurrent)
        with their unit-equipped host unit. Official unit ASEV notification will be sent to the
        unit not less than 90 days prior to the scheduled visit. The notification message will
        include ASEV team composition, transportation requirements, special interest items,
        and other details of the visit. Initial planning dates for unit ASEVs are coordinated
        with AFRC and NGB IG and A3V counterparts, and are published semi-annually in
        the AMC/IG Command-Wide Inspection Schedule and posted on the AMC/A3V
        website.     Unit scheduling conflicts should be reported to AMC/A3VS for
        consideration; all changes will be coordinated with the respective MAJCOM, with
        final approval by the AMC/A3.
        2.5.1.5.2. (Added-AMC) Flight evaluations should represent a cross section of the
        unit's operational mission. Instructors may be asked to demonstrate maneuvers to help
        assess instructor ability. All crewmembers may be asked to accomplish specific tasks
        or maneuvers for their crew qualification to assess proficiency.
        2.5.1.5.3. (Added-AMC) ASEV teams should complete all AF Forms 8 for in-flight
        evaluations before departure. At the unit commander’s discretion, and with ASEV
        evaluator’s approval, evaluations administered by ASEV flight examiners may be
        credited toward periodic evaluation requirements. This request must be made prior to
        the start of the evaluation. Complete remaining ground items within 2 months (AFRC
        and ANG units may use entire eligibility period for the accomplishment of requisites)
        but not later than the end of the eligibility period.
     2.5.1.6. (Added-AMC) ASEV Grading. A unit-level overall ASEV grade will be
     awarded. At the conclusion of the visit, the ASEV team chief will provide feedback (oral
     and written) to the unit commander and staff. In addition, AMC/A3 or designated
     representative will release an ASEV written report following review/endorsement. ASEV
     teams will identify those areas not in compliance with current guidelines and include as
     ―required improvements.‖ Units will report corrective action to AMC/A3V within 90
     days after receiving the final report. This report will be in the form of an official
     memorandum signed by the unit’s operations group commander to AMC/A3V. It will
     provide specifics on what corrective action was taken to resolve each of the ―required
     improvements‖ to bring each of the designated areas into compliance.
     2.5.1.7. (Added-AMC) ASEV Programs. All unit Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and
     Aircrew Resource Management System programs are subject to inspection. In addition,
     compliance with HHQ Fuel Efficiency Initiatives will be subject to inspection in the
     Special Interest Item section. The AMC/A3V ASEV Standards Guide provides
     information and guidance on specific programs subject to assessment by the ASEV team.
     Individual programs will be awarded a grade using the following scale:
18                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


         2.5.1.7.1. (Added-AMC) Outstanding: Program exceeds all requirements and is
         noted as a ―best practice‖ by program evaluators.
         2.5.1.7.2. (Added-AMC) Excellent: Program exceeds             requirements with only
         minor deviations noted.
         2.5.1.7.3. (Added-AMC) Satisfactory: Program meets requirements with some
         deviations noted. This is the ―standard‖ ASEV program grade – equivalent to a Q1
         flight evaluation.
         2.5.1.7.4. (Added-AMC) Marginal: Program meets most requirements with
         significant discrepancies noted.
         2.5.1.7.5. (Added-AMC) Unsatisfactory: Major discrepancies noted that degrade
         program effectiveness.
     2.5.1.8. (Added-AMC) ASEV Results. Approved unit ASEV Reports are posted on
     the AMC/A3V website.
  2.5.2. (Added-AMC) Staff Assistance Visits.
     2.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V (AFRC/A3V for AFRC Units) will conduct a
     scheduled mid-term Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) between ASEVs. Notification of the
     SAV will be sent to the unit approximately 45 days prior to SAV team arrival.
     2.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V will normally not conduct a SAV in the 6 month
     period prior to a stan/eval inspection.
     2.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) Reports generated by a SAV will be informal (internal use
     only). Results from AFRC SAVs administered IAW paragraph 2.5.2.1 (Added) will be
     briefed to the AFRC/A3 and forwarded to NAF/A3 and AMC/A3V.
  2.5.3. (Added-AMC) Informal Visits. For AMC evaluators visiting AMC units, prior
  coordination for an informal visit is not required. Informal visits to AFRC units other than to
  administer a pyramid evaluation will be coordinated through AFRC/A3V. AFRC NAF
  evaluators may perform informal visits within their NAFs with NAF/A3 approval. If the
  purpose of visit is other than continuation training or pyramid evals, HHQ evaluators will
  informally in/out-brief with the OG/CC. Reports, if generated, will be informal (for internal
  use only).

                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.
       3.2.1.1. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV personnel will be designated by memorandum by the
       434 OG/CC. 434 OG/OGV normally will be composed of the following positions as a
       minimum:
          3.2.1.1.1. (Added-434ARW) Chief of Standardization and Evaluation (Air Reserve
          Technician [ART] Pilot)

       N/N evaluation program.
       3.2.1.9. (Added-AMC) For non-collocated OG units with different MDS aircraft, the
       OG/CC will determine the basing location for each MDS/OG evaluator.
   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
20                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


     3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
     of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
     Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
     3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
     Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
     Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
     3.2.2.2. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will create all AF Forms 8 in the Patriot Excalibur
     (PEX) stan/eval module based off data submitted by examiners on the AF IMT 3862,
     Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet. AF Forms 8 should be reviewed using chapter 7 and
     attachment 3 of AFI 11-202V2_AMCSUP_1 and using the latest Headquarters Air
     Mobility Command (AMC) Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Visit (ASEV)
     Standards Guide checklist. All AF Forms 8 created by one OGV examiner should be
     reviewed by another OGV examiner prior to soliciting signatures.
     3.2.2.3. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
     (FEFs). If not maintained by the squadron Stan/Eval function, maintain unit FEFs.
     3.2.2.3. (434ARW) A Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) will be created and maintained by
     434 OG/OGV for each aircrew member assigned or attached for flying to any squadron in
     the 434 Operations Group. The folders will be kept in a secure area in 434 OG/OGV.
     The FEF will be treated as a controlled item and handling of the FEFs will be coordinated
     with 434 OG/OGV staff.         See paragraphs 7.8.5.1 and 7.8.5.3.3 for FEF review
     information.
     3.2.2.4. Establish procedures for requisite Aircrew Exams (see Chapter 6).
     3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
        3.2.2.5.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.5.1. (AMC) Include the following areas in trend analysis (if available):
        open/closed book examination program, evaluations, supplementary evaluation
        program, supervisory observations, and ATS contractor feedback.
        3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
        discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
        instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.
        3.2.2.5.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
        3.2.2.5.5. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see
        Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date
        the trend was identified.
        3.2.2.5.5. (AMC) Report trends to AMC/A3V and appropriate AFRC NAF/A3V
        (4AF or 22AF) quarterly (AFRC and ANG units semi-annually) in SEB minutes.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                21


       3.2.2.5.6. (Added-434ARW) 434th Operations Group Trend Program. The purpose
       of the trend program is to recognize negative trends as early as possible in order to
       correct problem areas when they develop. When a negative trend has been identified,
       the goal is to correct that trend thoroughly and efficiently using the procedures in this
       supplement. Trend data can be used to recommend and initiate changes to training
       programs and directives.
          3.2.2.5.6.1. (Added-434ARW) Flight evaluation trend analysis will be
          accomplished by 434 OG/OGV. Negative trends can be identified by an increase
          in negative comments on flight evaluations or from other sources. Trend data can
          be collected from instructor meetings, crewmember feedback, supplementary
          evaluations, aircrew testing, safety reports, simulator contractor instructors,
          Standardization and Evaluation Boards (SEB) and Training Review Panels.
          Flight examiners will use the AF IMT 3862 to report trends data from flight
          evaluations. Negative comments of 20% or greater will create a negative trend.
          However, it is not necessary to have 20% in order to declare an item a trend and
          implement corrective programs.
          3.2.2.5.6.2. (Added-434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will assign the OPR and the office
          of collateral responsibility for negative trends requiring training for corrective
          actions. 434 OG/OGV will approve the training plan and monitor the training
          process.
          3.2.2.5.6.3. (Added-434ARW) Trends will be reported in the SEB minutes.
          New trends identified will be discussed and recorded during the SEB covering
          that time period. Corrective action will be applied and the effectiveness of this
          action will be reported during the next semester’s SEB. Closure or continuance of
          a trend will be documented in the SEB minutes.
          3.2.2.5.6.4. (Added-434ARW) PEX is the primary means of tracking flight
          evaluation trends. 434 OG/OGV will enter trend data into PEX from examiner
          AF IMT 3862 comments. A secondary tracking method may be used until PEX is
          able to track negative comments on events that are graded ―Q‖ overall.
          3.2.2.5.6.5. (Added-434ARW) Examination trend data will be compiled
          utilizing PEX.
          3.2.2.5.6.6. (Added-434ARW) Use any applicable method to highlight, train
          and correct negative trends. Some possible methods are Hangar Flying, instructor
          meetings, stan/eval briefings, commanders calls, aircrew briefings, pamphlets,
          guides or Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) releases. Instructors should
          emphasize trends during ground and flight training activities while the trend is
          open.
          3.2.2.5.6.7. (Added-434ARW) If negative trends indicate improper training
          accomplished at any formal training school, 434 OG/OGV will send a copy of the
          trend information to the applicable formal school.
          3.2.2.5.6.8. (Added-434ARW) Monitor progress toward trend closure utilizing
          on-going evaluations and instructor observations while the trend remains open. A

        Evaluations (OME) for unit assigned personnel. Exceptions may be approved by the
        Chief, 434 OG/OGV or the OG/CC. The 434 OSS/DOT should confirm that all
        training is accomplished prior to 434 OG/OGV administering the evaluation.
     3.2.2.19. (Added-434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will manage a combined flight evaluation
     program. The 434 Operations Group, the 72 ARS and the 74 ARS Stan/Eval functions
     will be performed by the 434 OG/OGV under the supervision of the 434 OG/CC.
     Squadron functions will be limited to designating examiners to conduct flight
     evaluations. The squadrons and 434 OG/OGV will maintain copies of squadron
     examiner designation memorandums.
        3.2.2.19.1. (Added-434ARW) PEX will be the primary means of tracking zone
        expiration dates. Crewmember notification letters are generated by PEX and will be
        sent out by e-mail at the beginning of eligibility periods to ensure the maximum time
        for completing requisite items. Electronic notifications will be sent to the
        crewmember and the shop chief. This notification will list the requirements needed to
        complete the flight evaluation.
        3.2.2.19.2. (Added-434ARW) Flight evaluations should be scheduled in the fifth
        month of eligibility. Every effort will be made to avoid administering flight
        evaluations in the last month of eligibility. Crew members should complete periodic
        evaluation requisites prior to flight. Accomplishment of requisites will be tracked in
        PEX. 434 OG/OGV will work closely with 72 ARS and 74 ARS shop chiefs for
        scheduling of flight evaluations to ensure pyramid requirements are met and
        requisites are complete.
        3.2.2.19.3. (Added-434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will develop and distribute an
        overprint of the AF IMT 3862. 434 OG/OGV will normally provide individualized
        overprints of the AF IMT 3862 for each evaluation and supply it to the scheduled
        examiner prior to the evaluation. Alternatively, the overprint form is available on the
        Local Area Network (LAN) for any examiner to print. 434 OG/OGV will also
        provide access to a pamphlet to aid with note taking during the evaluation.

         3.2.2.19.4. (Added-434ARW) AF IMT 3862s completed by flight examiners will be
         reviewed by 434 OG/OGV for accuracy/errors. When all items on the flight
         evaluation and all requisites are complete, the AF IMT 3862 will be used to generate
         a final AF Form 8. 434 OG/OGV will transcribe the information from the AF IMT
         3862 into PEX to create the AF Form 8. Temporary evaluation documentation will
         be posted in the FEF. 434 OG/OGV will ensure proper completion, routing, and
         filing of AF Forms 8 for all evaluations. Once all the signatures have been obtained,
         434 OG/OGV will file the AF Form 8 in the FEF and remove the temporary
         evaluation documentation. 434 OG/OGV will print and post an updated AF Form
         942, Record of Evaluation in the FEF.
         3.2.2.19.5. (Added-434ARW) PEX will be used to track the processing of the AF
         Forms 8. Incomplete evaluations will remain as open evaluations in PEX to ensure
         completion within the prescribed time limits. Once all signatures are complete on the
         AF Form 8, they will be input into PEX to complete the tracking process.
         3.2.2.19.6. (Added-434ARW) After completion of all evaluation requirements, an
         AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report, will be submitted
         by 434 OG/OGV to SARM personnel for input into ARMS. Enter the completion
         date of the flight phase of the evaluation on the AF IMT 1522. When applicable, 434
         OG/OGV will submit an AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification
         Worksheet, to change an individual’s qualification level.
     3.2.2.20. (Added-434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will conduct annual supplement and process
     guide reviews. Additionally, supplements and process guides will be reviewed when
     parent AFIs change.

           formally qualified by signature of final approving officer on the AF Form 8 or
           certified by signature of certifying official on AF Form 4324. Pilots initially
           qualifying to aircraft commander or re-qualifying to aircraft commander due to
           non-currency more than 12 months, will be certified at home station before
           serving "in command" unsupervised. Crew-members other than pilots may
           perform primary crew duties (unsupervised) before return to home station, if the
           initial or re-qualification evaluation is successfully completed and the flight
           examiner annotates one copy of the flight authorization with "initial or re-
           qualification complete, date, and signature" next to crew member's name. The
           flight examiner may then depart the crew. Normally, complete all administrative
           actions before flight in the new crew qualification.
           3.3.2.12.2.2. (Added-AMC) Conduct R&C Board to review adequacy of
           training at 1 and 2-month points of an aircrew member’s re-qualification progress
           or when crewmembers fail to meet established standards and are placed in
           training status.
           3.3.2.12.2.3. (Added-AMC) Conduct R&C Board to review all circumstances
           for possible downgrade when it is suspected an individual should no longer serve
           in the current crew position due to substandard performance. Commander directed
           downgrade procedures will be IAW paragraph 5.9
           3.3.2.12.2.4. (Added-AMC) R&C Board action is not required for: commanders
           and vice/deputy commanders at wing, group, and squadron level, NAF/CC, active
           duty advisors to AFRC and ANG units, flight examiners assigned to MAJCOM,
           NAF, and OG, and individuals who are re-qualifying or upgrading to a position in
           which they were current and qualified during the previous 12 months.
           3.3.2.12.2.5. (Added-AMC) Units maintain a two-year history (4-year UE
           AFRC and ANG) of all R&C board minutes. Utilize Table 3.1 (Added) for
           R&C minutes format.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                           29


          3.3.2.12.2.6. (Added-AMC) R&C minutes format: see Table 3.1 (Added)
          Minutes must include date of board, members present, actions taken to include,
          affected member’s name, rank, certifications obtained, de-certifications and
          details of other actions taken, etc. NOTE: R&C Board Minutes are exempt from
          reporting requirements and licensing according to AFI 33-324.
          3.3.2.12.2.7. (Added-434ARW) Specific reviews of training and evaluation for
          crew members meeting the R&C board will be conducted at the R&C. General
          reviews of training, evaluations, and recommendations for upgrade/downgrade
          will be accomplished at the squadron level during the Squadron Review Board
          (SRB). Stan/Eval items will be submitted to the SRB by 434 OG/OGV. 434
          OG/OGV will review SRB minutes for action items needing their support when
          they are distributed each month.
       3.3.2.12.3. (Added-AMC) R&C Board - Procedures:
          3.3.2.12.3.1. (Added-AMC) Conduct R&C Board at the squadron or detachment
          level (AFRC and ANG units without squadron Standardization/Evaluation
          function conduct R&C board at group or wing level). Wing and group review,
          certification, and interview procedures will be detailed in the unit supplement.
          3.3.2.12.3.2. (Added-AMC) R&C Board - Composition. Commanders should
          preside at all R&C Boards. Squadron/DO may preside in the commander’s
          absence, and the commander will review R&C Board actions and acknowledge by
          endorsing the R&C minutes. Composition of R&C Board is at the discretion of
          the commander and will include board president and representatives from training
          and Stan/Eval. Other functions i.e. safety and maintenance are highly encouraged
          to attend.
          3.3.2.12.3.2. (434ARW) The R&C board will normally be held at the group
          level and the OG/CC or the OG/CD will preside over the board. In addition to the
          board president, OGV and DOT, normal composition includes WG/SE, the
          SQ/CC and/or the SQ/DO and the shop chiefs (DOP and/or DOB) from the
          squadron of the crewmember meeting the board. Maximum participation by
          Traditional Reserve leadership is encouraged. The board is scheduled on an as-
          needed basis.
          3.3.2.12.3.3. (Added-AMC) The board president interviews aircrew members
          meeting the R&C Board for certification. Board members brief pertinent aspects
          of the unit's mission including special items of emphasis. In addition, the Sq/CC
          must review and certify all crewmembers upon completion of Mission
          Certification Training NOTE: Any wing or group review, certification, or
          interview process above the squadron or detachment is in addition to the squadron
          or detachment process.
          3.3.2.12.3.3. (434ARW) Due to Reserve member limited availability, crew-
          members meeting the board are not required to attend the actual board. However,
          they are required to be interviewed by the board president prior to R&C
          certification. 434 OG/OGV will attempt to schedule the R&C board when the
          aircrew member is available to attend.

        3.3.2.12.4. (Added-AMC) R&C Board Actions - Aircrew Member Fails to Meet
        Standards. R&C Board actions for aircrew members who fail to meet established
        standards in their aircrew position and are placed in a training status are as follows:
            3.3.2.12.4.1. (Added-AMC) If the aircrew member has not re-qualified within
            one month (or first Unit Training Assembly [UTA] for AFRC and ANG units,
            whichever is greater) after the disqualifying event, the R&C board will convene
            to determine the adequacy of training and successful progress while completing
            re-qualification requirements.
            3.3.2.12.4.2. (Added-AMC) For individuals not re-qualified by the last day of
            the second month (AFRC and ANG third month IAW paragraph 7.3.5.6.1.1), the
            squadron/detachment will convene a second R&C Board to determine appropriate
            action (e.g., recommend re-training/re-qualification, Flying Evaluation Board
            [FEB] IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings
            and Badges, airman re-classification, etc.). Any recommendation for additional
            training beyond the additional training due date must be approved by the
            individual's wing or group commander.
            3.3.2.12.4.3. (Added-AMC) Before initiating FEB or airman reclassification
            action, the SQ/CC will counsel the crew member recommended for removal from
            flying status.
  3.3.3. Squadron Stan/Eval Organization.
     3.3.3.1. The squadron Stan/Eval function will consist of a Chief of Stan/Eval who is a
     certified flight examiner in a squadron weapon system.
     3.3.3.1. (AMC) Squadron Stan/Eval manning will be consistent with the squadron’s
     Unit Manning Document. (AFRC, ANG see paragraph 4.2.4)
        3.3.3.1.1. Waiver authority is the OG/CC. Document waivers in SEB minutes (see
        Attachment 2).
        3.3.3.1.2. For units undergoing conversion, the chief of Stan/Eval may be qualified in
        the weapon system to which the unit is converting, even if none are yet assigned.
     3.3.3.2. The chief of squadron Stan/Eval will report directly to and be rated by the
     squadron commander, or as specified by MAJCOM supplement.
     3.3.3.3. Further manning will be as directed by the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     3.3.3.4. (Added-AMC) Special mission qualifications for which the squadron has
     mission responsibility will be represented by a minimum of one flight examiner per
     applicable crew position.
     3.3.3.5. (Added-AMC) Squadron evaluators will be evaluated by the senior squadron
     evaluator or higher. Squadron Commanders and operations officers are authorized to
     evaluate squadron assigned and attached evaluators (other than senior evaluators in DOV

                                          Chapter 4

                                   FLIGHT EXAMINERS

4.1. General. The evaluation portion of the Aircrew Stan/Eval Program is administered by
flight examiners at the HHQ and unit levels.
4.2. Selection.
   4.2.1. Select flight examiners from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors
   (EXCEPTION: Senior flight examiners, see paragraph 4.4.).
   4.2.1. (AMC) Flight Examiners should not be a current flight safety officer.
       4.2.1.1. (Added-434ARW) Flight Examiner Training Program. Prior to accomplishing
       their first evaluation, newly designated flight examiners will accomplish the following:
           4.2.1.1.1. (Added-434ARW) Complete the examiner Computer Based Training
           (CBT) modules (identifiers A060A, A060B and A060C).
           4.2.1.1.2. (Added-434ARW) Interview with a 434 OG/OGV examiner of like
           specialty. This will include hands-on training of local 434 OG/OGV processes for
           executing an evaluation from start to finish.
           4.2.1.1.3. (Added-434ARW) Read and thoroughly review AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-
           2KC-135V2 and the AMC and Grissom supplements to these AFIs.
           4.2.1.1.4. (Added-434ARW) Time and schedule permitting an ―over-the-shoulder‖
           flight with a flight examiner of like specialty is desired. The flight examiner will
           administer the evaluation and sign the AF Form 8, not the trainee. The goal of the
           over-the-shoulder sortie is for the trainee to observe performance of examiner duties
           to include: the mission briefing, the examiner briefing, the Emergency Procedures
           Evaluation (EPE), the evaluation debrief, and completion of the AF IMT 3862.
           4.2.1.1.5. (Added-434ARW) Meet the R&C board and be interviewed by the board
           president. After the R&C, 434 OG/OGV will document the upgrade on the AF Form
           4324 for input into ARMS and certification on the Letter of Xs.
       4.2.1.2. (Added-434ARW) Previously certified flight examiners are not required to
       accomplish items in paragraphs 4.2.1.1.1 or 4.2.1.1.4.
       4.2.1.3. (Added-434ARW) Flight Examiner Decertification. Individuals no longer
       required to perform unit evaluation duties will be removed from their attached unit’s
       assigned flight examiner letter and changes forwarded to 434 OG/OGV. 434 OG/OGV
       will ensure the AF Form 4324 downgrading the individual is accomplished and the Letter
       of Xs is updated.
   4.2.2. The chief of the respective MAJCOM or NAF Stan/Eval function will select and
   designate in writing HHQ flight examiners. Copies of the designation memo will be sent to
   all units where HHQ flyers are attached to fly.
   4.2.3. The OG/CC and SQ/CC will each select, and designate in writing, all OGV and
   Squadron flight examiners (respectively).
 34                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


      4.2.3.1. The OG/CC and SQ/CC may designate additional OGV or squadron flight
      examiners (respectively) who are not assigned to OGV or the squadron when necessary
      to meet unique unit requirements.
      4.2.3.2. Annotate all flight examiners [to include attached and Senior flight examiners
      (see paragraph 4.4) in the squadron letter of certification and record in SEB minutes (see
      Attachment 2).
      4.2.3.2. (AMC) Unit certification document is Letter of X’s replacing the use of
      1381/4348s. The Letter of X’s is populated by signed AF Form 4324s. See Attachment 8
      for a sample Letter of X’s.
      4.2.3.3. (Added-434ARW) Squadron stan/eval is limited to flight examiner manning.
      Squadron commanders of the 72 ARS and the 74 ARS will designate flight examiners
      from their squadron and may also designate examiners assigned to the 434th Operations
      Support Squadron (OSS) but attached to their squadron for flying. Sufficient numbers in
      each crew specialty will be qualified to meet expected evaluation requirements for
      recurring evaluations. Each flying squadron will designate a senior examiner for each
      aircrew specialty and may designate an alternate senior examiner. The 434 OG/CC will
      approve all squadron and group level flight examiners. Recommendation for examiner
      upgrade to the OG/CC is normally accomplished through the SRB process. Squadron
      commanders will document examiner designation by memorandum and forward to 434
      OG/OGV.
   4.2.4. For AFRC and ANG units:
      4.2.4.1. The USAF advisor may be designated as a flight examiner.
      4.2.4.2. Air Technician (AT)/Air Reserve Technician (ART) /Active Guard and Reserve
      (AGR) serving in a military position that does not require maintaining mission
      ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as flight examiners.
      4.2.4.3. (Added-AMC) For AFRC and ANG units, one alternate flight examiner per
      MDS crew position may be designated to administer flight evaluations in the absence of
      the senior evaluator.
      4.2.4.4. (Added-AMC) ART/Air Technician/AGR personnel should occupy senior
      evaluator positions. For all aircrew positions, when a non-technician/AGR fills a
      Stan/Eval Unit Manning Document (UMD) position, units may assign a technician/AGR
      in that crew position to the Stan/Eval division. In this case, the technician will assume the
      duties of the senior evaluator for that crew position and may administer all evaluations.
4.3. Flight Examiner Functions.
   4.3.1. Conduct aircrew evaluations IAW Chapter 5 and document IAW Chapter 7.
   4.3.2. Maintain qualification as instructors (N/A for senior flight examiners, see paragraph
   4.4.2).
   4.3.3. Administer evaluations only within their weapon system/aircrew specialty and only
   evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification and/or certification.
   EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI11-2MDS, Vol 2.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                35


  4.3.3. (AMC) Unit-level flight examiners will only administer SPOT evaluations within
  their respective MDS and crew position unless directed by OG/CC.
     4.3.3.1. Waiver authority for flight examiners to evaluate mission/skill sets in which they
     are not certified is the OG/CC. For senior flight examiners (see paragraph 4.4), waiver
     authority is the next commander in their flying chain of command
  4.3.4. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
  requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
  MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examiner. MAJCOMs may establish procedures in
  their supplement for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside of NAFs/units within
  their own MAJCOM (see also paragraph 2.3.5).
  4.3.4. (AMC) Associate and host unit OG/OGV flight examiners may evaluate aircrew
  counterparts in both their OG and their Associate OG. Squadron or Detachment Flight
  examiners may administer evaluations outside their unit, with the approval of the examinee's
  squadron commander. HQ AMC and HQ AFRC flight examiners may perform flight
  evaluations on any 618 TACC mobility mission with Active Duty or AFRC crews. For
  evaluations of ANG crewmembers, follow guidance provided in paragraph 2.3.2.12.3
  (Added).
  4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
  and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
     4.3.5.1. (Added-434ARW) Examiners will debrief the crewmember on the flight
     evaluation in a timely manner, preferably the same day. Examiners must be cognizant of
     the examinee’s availability limitations and next scheduled event when delaying the
     debriefing. Debriefings should be held in a private location. For ―Q-1‖ performance,
     supervisory attendance is not mandatory but is encouraged. If discrepancies result in
     assignment of additional training and/or supervised status, consult 434 OG/OGV.
  4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
  (applies to both the examinee as well as any accompanying aircrew).
  4.3.7. As soon as possible, notify the examinee’s squadron commander (or available
  supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
  or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.3.3).
  4.3.7. (AMC) When a flight examiner observes less than Qualification Level ―Q-1‖
  performance from any crew-member not being evaluated, the flight examiner will consult
  with appropriate qualified personnel and (through the OGV Chief) will complete a follow-on
  recommendation for appropriate action to the unit commander (e.g., commander directed
  downgrade, follow-on N/N evaluation, additional training, etc.). The unit commander will
  determine the final course-of-action in accordance with ―commander-directed downgrade‖
  procedures.
  4.3.7. (434ARW) Examiners observing any less than ―Q-1‖ performance will notify the
  SQ/CC, SQ/DO or shop chief and 434 OG/OGV prior to debriefing so they can attend the
  debriefing if available. After the examiner and unit commander determine the course of
  action, 434 OG/OGV will coordinate the action and will implement Go/No-Go safeguards as
36                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


  necessary. 434 OG/OGV will ensure the AF Form 4324 downgrading the individual is
  accomplished when required.
     4.3.7.1. (Added-AMC) The flight examiner normally does not assume the examinee's
     position for unsatisfactory performance. If warranted, the flight examiner may assume the
     duties of that crew member, if current and qualified. Advise the crew and assume full
     responsibility for the crew position for the rest of the mission leg. In the mobility system,
     evaluators will notify the mission execution authority immediately and coordinate follow-
     on action (replacement, if required). The evaluator should be prepared to continue follow-
     on missions if directed by the execution authority.
     4.3.7.2. (Added-AMC) If, in the examiner's judgment, the examinee can continue safely
     (under supervision) the flight examiner should not assume the examinee's duties.
     4.3.7.3. (Added-AMC) Flight examiners performing in-flight duties and not qualified
     and current for the crew position in which unsatisfactory performance is observed (non-
     specialty) will inform the aircraft commander immediately.
  4.3.8. (Added-AMC) FTU/CCTS evaluators may evaluate AMC and AMC-gained aircrew
  members at formal schools or as augmentees to ASEVs.
  4.3.9. (Added-AMC) For en route evaluations, flight examiner pilots may, at their
  discretion, serve as an augmented crewmember.
  4.3.10. (Added-AMC) Use the pyramid evaluation system for all periodic evaluations,
  which require higher echelon Flight Examiners (FE) to administer evaluations to lower
  echelon FEs and disallows any FE from evaluating his or her rater. See Table 4.1 (Added) of
  this supplement. In addition:
  4.3.10. (434ARW) Squadron senior examiners in one squadron may be utilized by the other
  squadron for pyramid evaluations when mission requirements dictate. The OGV Chief will
  be the Reviewing Officer in place of the ―DOV Chief‖ and ―SQ/DOV‖ in Table 4.1 since
  OGV accomplishes SQ/DOV functions. Final Approving Officers will be selected from the
  squadron the individual is attached to for flying (i.e. either the 72 ARS or 74 ARS, not the
  OSS).
     4.3.10.1. (Added-AMC) Table 4 1. (Added) lists the minimum level of FE, Reviewing
     Officer and Final Approving Officer for evaluation and Form 8 routing purposes.
     4.3.10.2. (Added-AMC) When a pyramid evaluation is not practical, request a waiver
     from the appropriate level of authority, e.g. OG/CC waiver required for Sq/CC to not
     receive a pyramid evaluation from OGV. Maintain the waiver in the individual’s FEF
     until incorporated on the AF Form 8. Document the waiver in Section D. Additional
     Comments on the individual’s AF Form 8.
  4.3.11. (Added-434ARW) Submitting Evaluation Documentation. Flight examiners will
  complete all applicable areas of the AF IMT 3862 (including trend information), sign the
  form and deliver it to 434 OG/OGV for processing. AF IMT 3862 worksheets will be
  completed in sufficient detail to accurately recreate the examinee’s performance. Ensure that
  less than qualified area/sub-area comments and trend information convey a clear and concise
  description of the activity and performance. 434 OG/OGV will transcribe the information
  from the AF IMT 3862 into PEX and generate the AF Form 8.

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
       5.2.1.2. (AMC) If in-flight evaluations (e.g. QUAL and MSN) cannot be completed
       within the same calendar month, use a separate AF Form 8 with a separate expiration date
       or as specified in AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol 2.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
           5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
           aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
           INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
           5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
           under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
           requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
40                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


  5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
            5.2.4.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) The flight evaluator will determine the examinee’s
            seat position (normally right seat) for the initial instructor pilot evaluation and
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                   41


            will include a minimum of one approach and landing.
         5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
         subsequent periodic evaluations.
         5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
         evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
         MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
         AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.1. (AMC) SPOT Evaluations. Examinee must receive notification before entering
     pre-mission or pre-departure crew rest. The unit's (90/120-day prior) ASEV notification
     message satisfies this requirement. Crewmembers should not receive more than one
     SPOT evaluation per calendar year. EXCEPTION: As directed by the commander, or as
     directed by AMC/A3V to meet ASEV evaluation requirements.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
         5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
         5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
         guidance for that periodic evaluation.
         5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
         1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
42                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


        The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
        those items for which the individual is non-current.
        5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
        IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
        5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
        Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
        5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
        5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
        5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
        evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. ―Normal
        preparation‖ will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        5.2.6.3.3. (Added-AMC) N/N In-flight Evaluation Program. Each level of
        command (SQ/OG/AMC) will execute a N/N program. Develop the N/N program as
        an assessment tool for overall unit readiness and to provide indicators for appraisal
        and re-focusing unit training programs. OG and SQ levels will develop and publish a
        program to sample a combined minimum of 15% of available (qualified to perform
        aircrew duties) crewmembers (by crew position) annually. Adjustments for unit
        deployment rates are authorized and must be defined in the unit supplement. If a unit
        has less than five crewmembers in a given crew position, N/N minimum is at the
        commander’s discretion. N/N evaluations given by HHQ may count towards the
        unit’s N/N goal. NOTE: HQ flight examiners performing N/N evaluations on local
        AFRC unit missions. HQ evaluators will notify the OG/CC in writing NLT seven
        days prior to intended dates of evaluations. Notification will include the names of the
        flight examiners and inclusive dates. The OG/CC may prohibit the evaluations,
        however, he/she will contact AFRC/A3V for a determination on when to reschedule
        the flight evaluations.
        5.2.6.3.4. (Added-AMC) Crewmembers will not receive more than one N/N
        evaluation per calendar year except as directed by their commander. This restriction
        does not prevent HQ AMC, HQ AFRC or AFRC/NAF evaluators from conducting
        HHQ N/N or SPOT evaluations.
        5.2.6.3.5. (Added-AMC) Avoid administering N/N evaluations within the eligibility
        period for the intended evaluation unless commander directed. This restriction does
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                            43


       not prevent HQ AMC, HQ AFRC or AFRC/NAF evaluators from conducting HHQ
       N/N or SPOT evaluations.
       5.2.6.3.6. (Added-AMC) For mobility aircrews, as a minimum, all N/N evaluations
       will include items designated under ―General‖ as defined in the appropriate aircrew
       member’s chapter of the AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol 2. Evaluate other areas, as
       appropriate.
       5.2.6.3.7. (Added-AMC) Evaluators will use items from the special interest
       program to target and assess specific areas during all N/N evaluations. Areas
       designated "special interest" are normally identified by higher headquarters message.
       AFRC, ANG, OG and squadron may also designate areas. Squadron and OG will
       provide feedback on special interest areas through the SEB. Squadron, OG, AFRC,
       ANG, and HQ AMC will develop a process to inform evaluators on the requirements
       of the special interest program.
       5.2.6.3.8. (Added-AMC) Detail the unit's N/N program (including N/N rate) in the
       unit supplement.
       5.2.6.3.8. (434ARW) No-Notice (N/N) Evaluation Program. The N/N program is
       managed by 434 OG/OGV for the entire Operations Group as a combined program.
       434 OG/OGV will attempt to distribute N/N evaluations evenly between the 72 ARS
       and the 74 ARS. N/N evaluations will be reported to the SEB.
          5.2.6.3.8.1. (Added-434ARW) N/N evaluations should be coordinated by 434
          OG/OGV through squadron leadership prior to the evaluation. 434 OG/OGV may
          authorize squadron examiners to assist with completion of no-notice program
          goals. In this case, the N/N evaluation will still be coordinated by 434 OG/OGV
          to ensure compliance with the N/N program.
          5.2.6.3.8.2. (Added-434ARW) N/N flight evaluations should be conducted on a
          variety of different types of missions flown by the Operations Group. N/N
          evaluations should not be accomplished at deployed locations. Publications
          checks will be conducted in conjunction with N/N flight evaluations if applicable.
          5.2.6.3.8.3. (Added-434ARW) N/N evaluations on sorties of any duration will
          be considered complete at the discretion of the examiner. Examiners will use
          sound judgment when selecting appropriate additional items to be evaluated.
          Pilots being evaluated should accomplish at a minimum one approach and one
          landing. The examiner will use the grading criteria described in AFI 11-2KC-
          135V2. Examiners should assess known negative trends.
          5.2.6.3.8.4. (Added-434ARW) Examiners should arrive for the evaluation at
          crew show-time but may arrive any time prior to the aircrew departing the
          squadron (so the aircraft commander can run go/no-go to add the examiner to the
          Flight Authorization). The examinee will be notified of the evaluation at the time
          of examiner arrival.
          5.2.6.3.8.5. (Added-434ARW) N/N Cargo Load Evaluations should normally be
          conducted under actual operational conditions. If necessary, this evaluation may
          be evaluated verbally or under static conditions. Examiners will use sound
 44                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


             judgment when selecting appropriate items to be evaluated.
             5.2.6.3.8.6. (Added-434ARW) For flight evaluations, the N/N program goal is a
             minimum of 15% for each crew position per year. This may be reduced by 1%
             for each month that a flying squadron in the Operations Group is deployed.
             5.2.6.3.8.7. (Added-434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will track eligibility for N/N
             evaluations. Normally, crewmembers in supervised status or in upgrade training
             will be exempt from N/N flight evaluations. Also, newly assigned crewmembers
             with less than three months on station will normally be exempt from N/N
             evaluations. Commander directed N/N evaluations take precedence over these
             exemptions. Attempt to distribute N/N evaluations proportionately among crew
             positions. Consider selecting newly assigned/upgraded crewmembers and
             crewmembers with recurring deficiencies when selecting crew members for N/N
             evaluations.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
          examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
          safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
          5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
          compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
          adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
          constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                 45


        of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
        examiner.
     5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
        5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
        the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
        discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
        proficiency.
        5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
        remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
        5.3.2.2.2. (434ARW) Additional Training. The flight examiner who administered
        the evaluation, EPE, or exam will advise 434 OG/OGV and squadron leadership of
        the deficiency. Additional training will be coordinated between the flight examiner,
        squadron leadership, and 434 OG/OGV. Depending on the extent of the additional
        training, squadron leadership can assign an instructor for specific training or use 434
        OSS/DOT to conduct a more extensive training process.
            5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
            or flying.
            5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
            be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
            5.3.2.2.2.2. (AMC) Will be complete by the last day of the second month
            (ANG/AFRC third month) following the date of the discrepancy.
            5.3.2.2.2.2. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will track the progress of the individual’s
            assigned additional training.
            5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
            additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
            action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
            8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
            5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
            7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.3. (AMC) Do not verbally evaluate takeoffs, instrument approaches, landings,
     aerial refueling contacts, cargo loads or nursing care standards unless specified in the AFI
     11-2MDS-Specific Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
46                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as ―Commendable‖
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
         5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
         assigned.
         5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
         5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
         5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
         evaluations and EPEs).
         5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
         justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
         5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
         the overall qualification level.
         5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
         requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
         consideration.
         5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                   47


          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
          always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
       5.4.1.2. (AMC) Publications Check. For SPOT evaluations, flight examiners will check
       currency and validity of aircraft pubs kits. For periodic evaluations, individual
       crewmember publications will be evaluated for currency and validity. In all evaluations,
       paper checklists will also be evaluated for currency and validity. For aircrew members
       participating in the Electronic Publications program, the publications review conducted
       as part of an evaluation will include a check for currency. The examinee will demonstrate
       ability to navigate through and locate information in the electronic media. Successful
       completion of requisite testing using electronic pubs satisfies this requirement. The
       examinee will demonstrate ability to locate information in paper publications required for
       in-flight use (i.e. checklists, publications kits, etc). If during the flight evaluation the
       publications are checked IAW AFI 11-215, this will suffice for the annual review. In this
       case the flight examiner will sign the AF Form 1522.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
 48                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
          5.5.1.1.4. (Added-AMC) Any requisite examination resulting in a failure to meet
          the minimum passing grade IAW paragraph 6.8. will result in an overall Q-3. After
          successful re-examination IAW paragraph 6.9, the overall qualification level will be
          annotated as ―3/1‖ in the qualified block on the AF Form 8.
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
          5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
          and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
          systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
          5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
          evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
          simulator/ATD, or verbally.
              5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
              evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
              5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
              INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
              cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
              evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
          5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
          the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
          for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                     49


          5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
          examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
          unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
          and 7.3.7.3.4.
          5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
          situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
          circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
          accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
          flight examiner)
          5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
          (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
   5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
   in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
   Vol 2).
       5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
       appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
       measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
       5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
       training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
   5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
       5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
       case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
50                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


  5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
  recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
  (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
     5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
     basis.
         5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
         IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
     5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
     period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
     training required.
     5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
     administer the recheck.
     5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
     Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
     5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
     recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
     evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
     5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
     remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
  5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
  evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
  mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
  the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
     5.6.2.1. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Downgrade to lower crew duty qualification. In
     those cases where failure of a flight evaluation results in downgrading to a lower crew
     duty qualification (that is, instructor pilot to aircraft commander, aircraft commander to
     first pilot, etc.), these individuals may perform duty in the lower position without
     supervision provided that this action was recommended by the flight evaluator and
     properly annotated on the AF Form 8.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
  5.6.3. (AMC) Instructors, flight examiners, or authorized Aircrew Training System (ATS)
  contractor instructor personnel administer additional training. All flight training will be
  conducted by a like specialty.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
         opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                 51


        specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
        similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
        all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
            5.6.3.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Initial qualification examinees will not fly as a
            qualified crewmember until additional training is complete.
            5.6.3.1.1.2. (Added-AMC) Qualification Evaluation. AECMs who Q-3 in one
            qualification aircraft will fly in supervised status in all aircraft until recheck in
            that aircraft is complete.
        5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
        examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
        5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
        qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
        supervised status for mission tasks.
            5.6.3.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) Mission evaluations graded overall Q-3 will result in
            non-mission ready status in that mission only. Units will follow AFI 11-421,
            Aviation Resource Management, guidance and use the AF Form 4324, Aviation
            Resource Management (ARMS) System Upgrade Worksheet, to update aircrew
            qualifications in ARMS.
        5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
        being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
        area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
        5.6.3.1.4. (AMC) An instructor or flight examiner graded Q-2 on any evaluation
        will not perform instructor or examiner duties until the Q-2 is cleared. Flight
        examiners will clear instructor Q-2s. Flight examiner Q-2s should be cleared
        according to the pyramid evaluation system.
            5.6.3.1.4.1. (Added-AMC) Re-evaluation may be administered in the aircraft,
            verbally, or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD) at the examiner's discretion.
     5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
     completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
     5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
     restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
     limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
     certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
     not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
     specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
     5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
     5.6.3.5. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Squadron commanders review the records of
     aircrew members who fail a flight evaluation. Squadron commander’s signature in
     Section III of the AF Form 8 satisfies this requirement.
        5.6.3.5.1. (Added-AMC) AGR, ART, and Traditional Reservist (TR) aircrew
        members are disqualified or removed from aviation service when they indicate a
 52                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


          repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance according to AFI 11-402, as
          supplemented, and reassigned to a non-flying position or removed under the
          provisions of AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.
          5.6.3.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian aircrew members are notified according to AFI
          36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program, when they fail to pass a
          qualification examination or flight evaluation. They may be removed from aviation
          service and reassigned to a non-flying position, or removed under the provisions of
          AFI 36-704 when they indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal
          performance.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s       may     extend
          evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
          IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
          supplements to this instruction.
          5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
          of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
          paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
          longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
          see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
          period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                     53


              5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
              5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
              5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
              5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
              5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
              than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
              before or during deployment.
       5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
           5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
           authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
 54                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.3. (AMC) For O-6 and below, HQ AMC/A3 is approval authority according to AFI
   11-202 Vol 1. Forward the request through the proper channels (Sq/CC, OG/CC,
   AMC/A3V, etc.). Multiple qualifications of General Officers is IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1.
   AMC/A3V AF Flight Nurse (FN) and Aeromedical Evacuation Technician (AET) examiners
   may maintain multiple qualifications in the C-17, C-130, KC-135 and C-21 when applicable.
       5.10.3.1. (Added-AMC) For AFRC, HQ AFRC/A3 is approval authority. Refer to AFI
       11-202 Vol 1, AFRC Sup 1, for procedures to request multiple qualifications.
       5.10.3.2. (Added-AMC) For ANG, approval authority is NGB/A3.
       5.10.3.3. (Added-AMC) Approved crewmembers completing multiple qualifications
       see the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol 1 for training requirements. Complete
       certification or evaluation according to the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol 2.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                 55


5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
56                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


  5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
  Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
  5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
  5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
  capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
  similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
  MDS Vol 2/MOU.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                57


                                          Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.1. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV is responsible for developing, maintaining, administering
   and monitoring the unit aircrew examination program. 434 OG/OGV will update applicable
   exams in accordance with current directives. If an error is found while taking a test, the
   crewmember should notify 434 OG/OGV as soon as possible so the error can be corrected.
       6.3.1.1. (Added-434ARW) Crewmembers should accomplish requisite examinations
       during the first four months of the evaluation period. In the event that tests aren’t
       accomplished during the first four months, 434 OG/OGV will send email reminders and
       request shop chiefs to schedule crewmembers for testing. Testing should be completed
       prior to the flight evaluation.
       6.3.1.2. (Added-434ARW) Exams will be taken in the 434 OG/OGV testing room and
       will be monitored by 434 OG/OGV or a designated representative. Testing is normally
       accomplished electronically using PEX, however written tests can be accomplished as an
       alternative method when necessary. Boldface will be written and the 434 OG/OGV
       examiner grading it will input the grade into PEX. 434 OG/OGV will provide access to
       all necessary publications for testing. The primary means of accessing publications will
       be electronically.
       6.3.1.3. (Added-434ARW) When requisite examinations are completed by written
       means instead of using PEX, the scores will be manually recorded in PEX. Written
       answer sheets and examinations will be retained by 434 OG/OGV until the AF Form 8 is
       completed. Written exams will be secured (locked in the file cabinet) when not in use.
       6.3.1.4. (Added-434ARW) Exams will be graded and reviewed with the crewmember
       immediately upon completion of a test. This ensures the exam is graded prior to the
       aircrew member’s next flight.
 58                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


      6.3.1.5. (Added-434ARW) When an individual fails an examination, 434 OG/OGV will
      place the individual in a supervised status and inform squadron leadership and shop
      chiefs. Shop chiefs and schedulers will ensure the individual will not fly unsupervised
      until a make-up examination is successfully re-accomplished. Boldface examination
      failures result in a grounded status and the individual will not fly until successful re-
      accomplishment. 434 OG/OGV will work with the individual’s shop chief to schedule
      the make-up examination.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
   6.4.1. (AMC) Unless otherwise specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol 2,
   individuals qualified as crewmembers in more than one MDS aircraft must complete open
   and closed book exam for each aircraft.
      6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
      be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
      references for open book examinations.
      6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
      the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
      safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
          6.4.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) Development and maintenance of SQB is N/A for C-17.
          SQB is developed and maintained by contractors not the units.
      6.4.1.3. (Added-AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol
      2, open book exam will be derived from the Secure Question Bank (SQB) for each crew
      position of each MDS. The OG/OGV will create and manage the open book examination
      process. The SQB will consist of no less than 10 ground operations/taxi questions. Open
      book questions will be drawn from appropriate information contained in FCIF Vols I, II,
      III, and IV.
      6.4.1.4. (Added-AMC) A portion of each open book exam will include questions
      pertaining to each mission qualification of the individual being tested. Include airdrop,
      AR, SOLL II, PNAF, cargo, instructor, etc., as required.
      6.4.1.4. (434ARW) The open book exam will consist of 40 questions for non-instructors
      and 50 questions for instructors covering all applicable areas.
   6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
   6.4.2. (AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Vol 2, mobility
   forces complete their closed book examination using a minimum of 20 questions from the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                59


  MQF. When developing a closed book examination from the MQF, the unit should select
  questions to sample aircrew knowledge areas or correct potential trends.
  6.4.2. (434ARW) The closed book exam will consist of 20 questions. All crewmembers
  will complete a Boldface exam in conjunction with the closed book exam.
     6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
     specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
     aircrew.
     6.4.2.1. (AMC) AMC/A3V will coordinate, build, maintain and distribute one common
     MQF for each crew position of each MDS. The MQF will contain at least 100 questions
     with periodic updates, as necessary. AMC/A3V may delegate a portion or all of MQF
     development and maintenance requirements to specific active duty, ANG, or AFRC
     units; or a designated civilian contractor providing this service, but will maintain active
     supervision of MQF contents.
         6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
         administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
         procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
         6.4.2.1.1. (AMC) MQFs are available for download on the AMC/A3V website. The
         OG will distribute the MQF to all unit aircrew members.
         6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
         Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
         necessary.
         6.4.2.1.2. (AMC) OGV will forward corrections to AMC/A3V.
     6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
     MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
  6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
  Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
  procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
  test.
  6.4.3. (AMC) Exam requirements follow open book format and the exam is normally
  generated at the unit level. IRC program and Instrument Examination questions are available
  on Air Force Flight Standardization Agency (AFFSA) website, IRC Page.
     6.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) instrument
     examinations remain valid concurrent with the individual's initial qualification instrument
     evaluation. IRC or equivalent courseware may satisfy this requirement. Units will
     determine an internal process for managing ENJJPT instrument examination dates and
     scores. Incorporate the scores on the individual’s first initial qualification AF Form 8.
  6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
  review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
  and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
  source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
  procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
 60                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


   6.4.4. (434ARW) Examination question banks will be reviewed and updated annually and
   when source publications change. Upon notification of a publication change, PEX questions
   will be sorted for that publication and verified or updated as required. Examinations will be
   randomly generated. Crewmembers are encouraged to present feedback on questions that are
   not pertinent or incorrect. The SQB will be changed as necessary to revise bad questions or
   references.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
   6.5.4. (Added-AMC) An initial qualification or requalification student who fails an
   Aircrew Training System (ATS) examination while attending FTU/CCTS training will retake
   the ATS exam and complete the appropriate open and closed book examinations before flight
   evaluations.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.

6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.1. (AMC) Boldface/CAPs. Examinations will consist of one question concerning each
   Boldface /CAPs applicable to an individual's specialty. Individuals qualified as crew
   members in more than one MDS aircraft must complete a Boldface/CAPs exam for each
   aircraft.
       6.8.1.1. (Added-AMC) AMC policy is that Boldface/CAPs will be written as depicted
       in the flight manual(dash 1 or Vol 3 for AECM) to include the correct crew positions for
       the prescribed action. Unit commanders will ensure that crews are trained to this
       standard; however, HQ AMC does not intend for examiners to quibble over punctuation
       or minor misspellings.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
       6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
       exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
       6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
       resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
       aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
       results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
       instrument qualification is required.

6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
6.10. (434ARW)Unit Periodic Examinations. Periodic testing will be accomplished at the
discretion of 434 OG/OGV or the commander. It may be used as a tool for correcting weak
areas, training in new equipment or procedures, or as a tool to be used at the commanders’
discretion. Exam length, open or closed book format, and due date will be designated for each
test. If not completed by the due date, the individual will be restricted from flying (grounded)
until successful completion.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.
   6.10.4. (Added-AMC) An AF Form 8 will not be generated simply for a failed unit periodic
   examination.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                     63


                                            Chapter 7

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
       7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
       (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
       7.3.2.3. The ―Eligibility Period‖ and ―Expiration Date of Qualification‖ blocks will use a
       three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
       7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
       ―INSTR‖), use upper and lower case letters.
64                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.

         7.3.4.2.2. For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization
         and location will reflect the FTU organization/location.
     7.3.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation

         7.3.4.4.2. (AMC) Enter N/A for all evaluations given within an eligibility period,
         but not intended to satisfy a recurring requirement (e.g. SPOT, N/N SPOT, etc.)
         7.3.4.4.3. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.8.3.2.3, enter the
         6-month period preceding the original expiration date (SQ/CCs extend only the
         expiration date, not the eligibility period).
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                 65


         7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 12 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 13, enter
         ―INSTM: Jun-Nov 12/QUAL: Aug 12-Jan 13‖ for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
         7.3.4.4.5. (Added-AMC) For combination evaluations intending to re-align the
         examinee’s check-rides, write the correct eligibility period of the in-phase check-ride
         on the top and N/A for the other. In the Examiner’s Remarks Section D. Additional
         Comments. Write this statement: ―The MSN (or QUAL) portion of the evaluation
         was given outside the eligibility period to re-align the check-ride dates.‖
  7.3.5. - Qualification.
     7.3.5.1. Ground Phase.
         7.3.5.1.1. Examination/Check.
            7.3.5.1.1.1. Make a separate entry for each ground requisite exam/evaluation.
            Discrepancies will be noted in the examiner’s remarks (see paragraph 7.3.7.3.3).
            7.3.5.1.1.2. If requisites exceed available lines, make combined entries or
            document additional requisite completion in the Comments section.
            7.3.5.1.1.3. Annotate an EPE as 1, 2, or 3 regardless of whether all or a portion of

66                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


     7.3.5.2. Flight Phase.
        7.3.5.2.1. (Form 8a) If applicable governing instructions require non-rated aircrew
        to demonstrate in-flight proficiency in more than one MDS, MAJCOMs may use a
        separate AF Form 8a for each MDS with flight phase evaluations IAW multiple
        qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
        paragraph 5.11.
        7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
            7.3.5.2.2.2. (AMC) The order of prefixes will be: INIT/RQ or N/N then SIM e.g.
            RQ SIM QUAL.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
               INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
               7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
               8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
               (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
               7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
               instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
            7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
            on separate days.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. (AMC) Make multiple single line entries when a combination
            evaluation is given and the prefix does not pertain to both parts of the check-rides
            even if both parts of the check-ride were given on the same day. For example a
            QUAL with RQ MSN would have two lines instead of a single line RQ
            QUAL/MSN.
            7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
            flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
            may be used.
        7.3.5.2.3. Date.
            7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
            7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
            over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                 67


            flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
            7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
            spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a ―1‖ (for Q1) or ―2‖ (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        ―3‖ (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., ―INSTM: 1‖ and
            ―QUAL: 2‖ in the qualified block or ―INSTM/MSN: 1‖ in the qualified block and
            ―QUAL: 3‖ in the unqualified block).
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.
        7.3.5.4.1. IAW paragraph 5.8.1. for evaluations that establish a new eligibility
        period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight
        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter ―N/A.‖
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or ―N/A‖ if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            ―N/A‖ for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter ―QUAL-Jul 12‖ under Qualified and ―INSTM-N/A‖ under
            Unqualified).
        7.3.5.4.4. (Form 8a) For evaluations without a flight phase requirement that
        establish a new eligibility period enter the month and year that is 17 months after the
        month in which the latest ground requisite was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.5. (Form 8a) For evaluations with a flight phase that establish a new
        eligibility period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which
        the flight phase evaluation was successfully completed.

AF Forms 4348.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                  77


7.6. (AMC)AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications (Optional). AMC no longer uses
AF Form 4348, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, and has replaced it with the Letter of
X’s (Attachment 8).
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
   7.6.1. (AMC) AMC Letter of X’s. Unit certification document is the Letter of X’s. This
   replaces the use of 1381/4348s. The Letter of X’s is populated by signed AF Forms 4324.
   See Attachment 8 (Added) for sample Letter of X’s. The unit training officer, in
   coordination with the SARM, will generate a monthly Letter of X’s to be signed by the
   SQ/CC or authorized official. SQ/DOV will maintain monthly letters for 12 months. Flight
   Evaluators may make pen and ink changes to the latest/master letter to update certifications
   until the next monthly letter is published. Changes must be initialed by the evaluator.
   Evaluators will not annotate own certifications. A copy of the latest Letter of X’s will be
   placed in the member’s FEF prior to PCS for record. Letter of X’s may be kept
   electronically provided a digital signature is produced from the Sq/CC or authorized official.
   7.6.1. (434ARW) AMC Letter of X’s. The Letter of X’s will be generated and maintained
   by 434 OSS/DOT and certified by the 434 OG/CC or OG/CD. It will be updated at least
   once a month. The most current, original, paper copy of each squadron’s Letter of X’s will
   be maintained by 434 OSS/DOT. When a new Letter of X’s is generated, 434 OG/OGV will
   check the accuracy of the Letter of X’s and inform 434 OSS/DOT of any errors so a
   correction may be made. Copies of the Letter of X’s will be posted electronically, in 434
   OSS/DOT, and in the mission planning room.
       7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
       documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
       members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
       qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
       required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
       7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
       aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
       certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
       7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
       entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
       member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
       unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
       7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
       SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
       transcriptions are accurate.
       7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
       directed by MAJCOM.
       7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
       entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.
   7.6.2. General Data Entry.

     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
     for flying) organization/location.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification in chronological order based on the date the action is
     completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 4348, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format, or as required for electronic forms.
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. Certified Event Title. Enter each certification title on the top block on the AF
     Form 4348.
     7.6.3.2. Enter the instructor’s rank, name and organization who completed applicable
     training for the certified event below the event title of the Certified Event block for the
     MDS under which the certification is given.
     7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
     7.6.3.4. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of the
     applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU if no
     AF Form 8/8a is issued.
     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.

     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                 79


          become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
          previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
          decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
          performance.
          7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
          box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
          organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
          Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
          due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
          decertification will be the date of certification loss.
          7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
          Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―Renamed (new
          title)‖ under Remarks.
          7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
          Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
          transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
   7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
   information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
   AF Form 4348.
   7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
   Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
   maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
   e-Publishing web site.
      7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
      section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
          7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
          generated AF Form 4348.
   7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
   certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
   certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
   are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
   Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
   signify transcription accuracy.

      rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification do not require an
      FEF, documentation will be IAW paragraph 8.1.
      7.8.1.2. The FEF must be maintained by a Stan/Eval functional office - normally in the
      organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
      7.8.1.3. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
      Stan/Eval function of the unit to which they are attached for flying.
      7.8.1.4. For personnel on inactive flying status, the FEF will be maintained with their
      Flight Records Folder (FRF).
      7.8.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
      the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
   7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
      7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
      into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
      maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
      7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,
      Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.
      7.8.2.3. Electronic FEF systems must be able to produce hard copies of FEF products,
      when needed, consistent with the guidance in this AFI. Additionally, the electronic FEF
      must be transportable.
   7.8.3. Contents. Divide the FEF into two sections:
      7.8.3.1. (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and
      any items authorized by the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement. Section I may contain
      two sub-sections.
          7.8.3.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top in chronological order with the most
          recent on top, followed by the AF Form 4348 (if used).
          7.8.3.1.2. Any additional information as directed by MAJCOM and/or unit
          supplement will be placed under the AF Form 942 and 4348 (if used).
          7.8.3.1.2. (AMC) Under the AF Form 942, maintain the following tabs, as required.
          Use AMC Form 457, Flight Evaluation Folder Tabs. Units must establish procedures
          for maintaining the FEF (e.g. AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or
          Special Operational Duty) in the unit supplement.
             7.8.3.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) TAB1--Special Mission Certifications. A Letter of
             X’s generated by the unit training officer, is the basic source document to provide

            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
                7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.
  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                               83


     7.8.4.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.8.4.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the ―For Official Use Only‖ label/stamp on both sides of the
     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
     7.8.5.1. (AMC) Document accomplishment with an ―Initial Review‖ entry and date
     entry on the AF Form 942. EXCEPTION: For all first-time Aeromedical Evacuation
     assignments, the AF Form 942 will be documented in the following sequence: ―AMC‖,
     ―Initial QUAL/MSN‖, followed by ―Initial Review‖.
     7.8.5.1. (434ARW) The initial review will be accomplished using the AMC/A37V
     ASEV STANDARDS GUIDE ―Flight Evaluation Folder Review Worksheet‖ as a guide.
     Once the review is completed, 434 OG/OGV will submit the AF IMT 1522 to the
     appropriate aviation resource manager for documentation in ARMS and document the
     review on the AF Form 942. The AF IMT 1522 will include the initial review date
     (identifier XFE2) and the dates of evaluation expirations (identifiers AA01, AA11, Q003,
     and Q180). Normally, 434 OSS/DOT generates the AF Form 4324 for newly assigned
     aircrew.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
84                           AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.2. (AMC) Accomplish NLT end of 12th month following initial or previous
        annual review.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (AMC) Document accomplishment with an ―Annual Review‖ and date
        entry on the AF Form 942. The initial review entry suffices for the annual review
        requirement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (434ARW) An annual FEF review using the AMC/A37V ASEV
        STANDARDS GUIDE ―Flight Evaluation Folder Review Worksheet‖ will be
        conducted within 12 months of the initial or previous annual review. FEF reviews
        will be aligned with aircrew member birth month as a method to distribute the
        workload more evenly each year. Accuracy of the 434 OG/OGV computer tracking
        system and ARMS dates will be verified as part of this review. Once the review is
        completed, 434 OG/OGV will submit the AF IMT 1522 to the appropriate flight
        records manager for entry into ARMS (identifier Q170).
        7.8.5.3.4. (Added-AMC) While all AF Forms 8 and Forms 942 shall be retained in
        the members FEF, additional information contained in the FEF which is not related to
        the member’s current MDS(s) is considered obsolete. Obsolete documents will be
        returned to the member for their records.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                85


     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
        7.8.6.2.1. (AMC) Units will utilize a locally developed log to document minor
        discrepancies.
        7.8.6.2.1. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will maintain a consolidated record of minor
        discrepancies from which individual aircrew discrepancy logs will be printed to place
        into FEFs.
            7.8.6.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) The log will include the following as a minimum:
            specific document and section affected, date error discovered, description of
            discrepancy, corrected data, AFI reference for the discrepancy/correction, and
            reviewer identification data.
            7.8.6.2.1.2. (Added-AMC) Minor discrepancy logs will be maintained under
            AMC Form 457, Flight Evaluation Folder Tabs, Tab 2, if required.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
        7.8.6.3.1. (AMC) When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies.
        7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
        without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
        contents of the FEF.
        7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
        white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
        official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
        corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
        7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
        allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
        and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
86                             AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.
     7.8.8.2. Outdated certification documents, ARMS products, medical recommendations
     and miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the
     aircrew member for disposal.

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.1. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will track expiration through ARMS and submit an AF
   IMT 1522 to SARM personnel after receipt of the certificate of successful completion.
   Failed or overdue exams result in grounding and the flight surgeon will not fly until
   successful completion of the examination.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

       ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
9.1. (AMC)FCIF. Information published in the FCIF is approved and signed by OG/CC, OGV
or designated representative. The files will be readily accessible to the flight crew.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.1. (AMC) The unit will develop and maintain an FCIF Library. At unit’s discretion, the
   FCIF library may be electronic, provided measures are in place to ensure currency of
   publications and unrestricted access by crewmembers. Units should prepare to support
   deployed forces with appropriate FCIF information. Units develop a deployment plan to
   successfully transfer or build a duplicate process to provide timely FCIF information to
   aircrews supporting deployed operations (i.e., Contingency, Business Effort, Staging, etc.)
   Units must advise aircrews how to obtain FCIF message traffic updates when away from
   home station.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.3. (AMC) FCIF Vol 1, Part A will be the table of contents of the FCIF library and index
   of outstanding FCIF message traffic. Vol 1 will be maintained in hard copy and will
   reference the location of any electronic library contents.
      9.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) Vol I organizes short-notice aircrew operational information
      into a four-part FCIF system. FCIFs must be clear, concise, and short and include a
      specific duration. Use sectional dividers or separate binders, as required to present the
      information in Parts A-D. Units develop an FCIF Vol 1 process to ensure aircrews review
      and acknowledge receipt of the appropriate information.
      9.1.3.2. (Added-AMC) OG/OGV use the AMC Form 446, Flight Crew Information
      File, to transfer, edit, and highlight new or revised material in Vols I through V, as well
      as higher HQ directed messages, guidance concerning safety, operations, etc. Do not
      delay posting FCIF Volume 1, Part B items for editing. OG/OGV will determine when
      materials will be removed from the FCIF. Maintain information as directed or until the
      information is incorporated in Part C (FCB) or appropriate aircrew directives.

   9.1.4. Current Read File. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to include an Index
   (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B and C (Note: Part C is optional)). MAJCOMs may
   add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
      9.1.4.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in FCIF Volumes I
      through V.
      9.1.4.1. (AMC) Part A: FCIF Index. Administrative tool summarizing outstanding
      FCIF messages and contents of the FCIF Library. The wing or group Stan/Eval office
      completes the FCIF index in January for each subordinate unit. Type the preparation date
      in the upper right-hand corner of the index. List all FCIFs that meet criteria for Volume I
      in the index. Publications included in the FCIF by subordinate units are added to the
      FCIF index by the unit. Wing publications not required in a subordinate unit's FCIF will
      be lined out on the subordinate unit's copy of the FCIF index. Include the location and
      instructions for accessing any electronic contents of the FCIF library.
      9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
      temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
      before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to all
      using MAJCOMs.
      9.1.4.2. (AMC) Part B: Current Read File. FCIF information identified by the
      originator or local commanders (as required) that crewmembers must review before
      flight. Includes publication notices, advisories, and general (operational type)
      information. Active duty host units will coordinate FCIFs with their reserve associate
      units. Crewmembers will document review of required FCIF items on the AF Form 396
      or through electronic means at units utilizing Patriot Excalibur (PEX) before the mission
      or flight.
          9.1.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC is lead command for mobility and tanker
          aircraft. AMC/A3V maintains Automated Message Handling System (AMHS)
          distribution lists. FCIF-type information will be coordinated (within time constraints)
          with user-command staffs. FCIF messages will have specific duration and MAJCOM
          applicability.

     9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
     not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
     9.1.4.3. (AMC) Part C: Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB). OG/OGV manages the FCB
     process to ensure vital information, not otherwise available to aircrews, is published and
     updated. The FCB provides aircrews with FCIF information as a general knowledge
     reference tool and ensures current information is available to aircrews away from home
     station. Review, publish, and consolidate FCBs quarterly beginning January of each year.
     Use AMC/A3V website listing current or rescinded FCIF messages. As a minimum, the
     FCB should contain all outstanding (exceeding the unit’s quarterly review) FCIFs. Host
     units will coordinate FCBs with their associate units. Host unit FCBs are applicable to
     their associate squadrons. Also see FCB requirements in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-
     Specific Vol 3.
        9.1.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) Include the latest copy in the FCIF. Include one copy in
        each unit mission kit. Units determine internal requirements (i.e. copy to all aircraft
        commanders, instructors, etc.).
        9.1.4.3.2. (Added-AMC) The FCB is signed by the chief, OGV and approved by the
        OG/CC (or equivalent) and (if applicable) reserve associate OG/CC (or equivalent).
        All items in the FCB cite the authority for inclusion, for example: Authority:
        AMC/A3V 092230ZAP019 message FCIF #01-04-11.
     9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
     separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
     exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
     in the FCIF volumes.
     9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.
     9.1.4.6. (Added-AMC) Part D: Theater Indoctrination Folders (Optional). Define
     Theater Indoctrination Program in FCIF Vol 1, Part D. Develop folders for four
     geographic areas: 1. Asia, Pacific, Australia, and Indian Ocean. 2. Africa and Middle
     East. 3. Europe, Baltic, and Russia. 4. Caribbean, Central and South America. Units may
     elect to consolidate common Theater Information (e.g., deployment checklist in a fifth
     folder titled: General Deployment Information.) Tailor contents of the folders to the
     unit’s mission. As a minimum, include Mission/Deployment Checklists,
     Airspace/Airfield Review, Theater Instrument Procedures, Organized Track System,
     Communication/Emergency Procedures, Border Clearance, Flight Planning, Special
     Military Operations, and other requirements, as necessary.
     9.1.4.7. (Added-434ARW) Read File Procedures. The number and the date of the latest
     Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) entry will be prominently displayed in the mission
     planning room. PEX is the primary method for posting and signing the FCIF. FCIF’s
     will also be printed using the AMC Form 446, Flight Crew Information File, as a backup
     to PEX. The printed version will be posted in the mission planning room for aircrew
     reference should PEX malfunction. If PEX malfunctions, each crew member will write
     the latest FCIF number next to their name on the flight orders and initial to verify they
     have read the latest FCIF.

        9.1.4.7.1. (Added-434ARW) An initial FCIF review will be accomplished by new
        aircrew members prior to their first flight at Grissom. The review will include
        reading all FCIFs and the Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB). Refer any questions to 434
        OG/OGV.
        9.1.4.7.2. (Added-434ARW) Visiting crewmembers (HHQ, etc.) are required to
        review all of FCIF Vol 1, Part B and the FCB prior to flying on 434 ARW aircraft.
        Those individuals will write the latest FCIF number and their initials on the flight
        orders next to their name, certifying that they have read the appropriate FCIF items.
     9.1.4.8. (Added-434ARW) Deployed FCIF Procedures. If Grissom is the lead tanker
     unit, 434 OG/OGV will build deployed FCIF Volume I binders before unit deployments
     to include active FCIFs, SIIs and the FCB. They will also provide directions to access
     electronic FCIF publication libraries. 434 OG/OGV will make every effort to obtain the
     deployed location fax number, e-mail address and voice contact numbers. 434 OG/OGV
     will transmit new FCIFs to the deployed location when they are published at home
     station. The deployed commander or operations officer will ensure the FCIFs are
     promptly posted for crew use. Home station FCIFs will supplement the local theater
     FCIF read file.
        9.1.4.8.1. (Added-434ARW) If a deployment is split into more than one operating
        location, "Deployed FCIF" binders should be available at each location. Trips out of
        the primary operating location need not be supported with "Deployed FCIF" binders.
        The deployed operations officer/FCIF monitor will decide when FCIF material should
        be relayed to aircrews away from the primary operating location.
     9.1.4.9. (Added-434ARW) FCIF Procedures While Off-Station (And Not Deployed). It
     is the aircraft commander's (AC) responsibility to daily check for changes to the FCIF
     while conducting off-station missions. Updates may be obtained by calling the
     Command          Post,    accessing     the   434      OG     Stan/Eval     SharePoint
     (https://sharepoint.afrc.af.mil/sites/434arw/OPS/StanEval/default.aspx), or checking
     the AMC Stan/Eval website. The Command Post will provide the latest FCIF information
     to the aircraft commander verbally or by fax. The aircraft commander is responsible for
     informing the rest of the crew about new FCIFs.
  9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
  Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
  requirements.
     9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
     authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft
     configuration.
     9.1.5.2. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the publications library
     containing, as a minimum, a listing of basic publications numbers and short titles.
     Publication dates, supplements and changes are not required.
        9.1.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Volume II. Contains Air Force/Joint/DOD/JCS directives
        and AMC supplements. As a minimum, include publications listed in Table 9.2
        (AMC), and others as determined by the OG/CC in support of the unit’s mission. A
        current listing is located on the AMC/A3V website. Directives listed in Attachment 1

9.2. Flight Related SII.
   9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis relating to existing procedure(s) designed to
   mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends.
       9.2.1.1. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures (reference guidance on
       issuing FCIFs in paragraph 9.1, above).
       9.2.1.2. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to
       include Safety Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related
       incidences, trend analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with
       equipment/procedures.
   9.2.2. SII(s) will be issued through the same process used to release FCIFs with the
   following elements:
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                  97


       9.2.2.1. Specific MDS applicability
       9.2.2.2. References (document, SIB, etc)
       9.2.2.3. Risk factors and trend details
       9.2.2.4. Specific emphasis actions to reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that generated the
       SII.
       9.2.2.5. Effective date of rescission
       9.2.2.6. SME/POC for further information
   9.2.3. SII(s) will be of limited duration (generally not to exceed 90 days).
   9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
   from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
   units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
   SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
   within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
   9.2.5. Units will place all applicable SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part B, for
   dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.6. All current MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed during flight
   briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission-specific SII(s) need only be briefed on those
   missions for which the SII is relevant.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight. Units will
provide guidance on this system in the unit supplement.
9.3. (AMC)Go/No-Go Procedures. [AMC-only] Units will limit the number of Flight
Authorization Approving Officials to no more than 6. Approving Officials must be in the grade
of O-4 or higher.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
       9.3.1.1. Form 8/8a qualification or appropriate ARMS products.
       9.3.1.2. Ground and flight currency items required for flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
       AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, and AFI 11-421 Aviation Resource Management.

       (see Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.4. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       9.3.1.5. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B) items.
   9.3.2. (Added-AMC) Operational Risk Management. All units under the command and
   control of 618 TACC will utilize the standard Aviation ORM worksheet to analyze
   associated risks for all 618 TACC directed missions. This worksheet will be integrated into
   the Go/No-go process. Units will maintain a hard copy of the worksheet for a period of 3
   months, if available.
98                            AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011


     9.3.2.1. (Added-AMC) ORM worksheet completion will be IAW Chapter 7 of AMCI
     90-903. The Fatigue and Stress Scorecard will be posted behind the last guide in
  9.3.3. (Added-434ARW) Go/No-Go Procedures. PEX is the primary means of tracking
  and displaying crewmember groundings and restrictions. Paper copies of data will be
  maintained in the mission planning room as a backup to the PEX electronic display.
     9.3.3.1. (Added-434ARW) PEX Go/No-Go Display. A crewmember whose name
     appears with a red dot is grounded and will not fly until the grounding discrepancy has
     been corrected. A crewmember with a yellow dot will be restricted to flying with an
     instructor of like specialty due to an overdue training event or a stan/eval restriction.
     EXCEPTION: there are some circumstances when AFI 11-2KC-135V1, KC-135 Aircrew
     Training allows unsupervised flight for some overdue training events depending on the
     flight profile. Clicking on the yellow dot will show the specific restriction or overdue
     event(s).
     9.3.3.2. (Added-434ARW) Go/No-Go Responsible Agencies. 434 OSS/DOT and 434
     OG/OGV will work together to insure training events are coded in PEX as either
     grounding (No-Go) or requiring instructor supervision (restricted status) based on AFI
     11-2KC-135V1 requirements. HARM and/or SARM personnel will update flight
     physicals, physiological training, Duty Not To Include Flying (DNIF) status,
     Aeronautical Order (AO) dates and Aviation Service Codes (ASC). 434 OG/OGV will
     administer the FCIF and update Stan/Eval restrictions. Each responsible agency will also
     update the applicable backup paper copies in the mission planning room with changes.
     9.3.3.3. (Added-434ARW) With the exception of FCIFs, PEX displays of aircrew status
     cannot be changed instantly by the crewmember or the OC. PEX updates require
     HARM/SARM, 434 OSS/DOT, 434 OG/OGV or shop chief input. When an aircrew
     member has recently accomplished an event not showing complete in PEX, the OC or
     AC may override PEX if source documentation is provided for that event. Before
     overriding PEX, OCs and ACs must ensure the event was actually completed by
     verifying the source document (AF IMT 1042, AF IMT 1522, etc).
  9.3.4. (Added-434ARW) Go/No-Go verification is started by shop chiefs when
  crewmembers are entered into the schedule to fly then reviewed in a pre-scheduling meeting.
  SARM specialists will verify Go/No-Go prior to putting crewmembers on the Flight
  Authorization (FA). Flight Authorization Approving Officials (FAAO) will verify status
  prior to signing the FA. Finally, the aircraft commander and the Operations Coordinator will
  use PEX to confirm each crewmember’s status.
     9.3.4.1. (Added-434ARW) SARM specialists will identify scheduled crewmembers that
     are overdue on required Go/No-Go items and will reconcile all discrepancies for review
     by the FAAO. If a crew member is grounded, flight orders will not include that crew
     member until the grounding discrepancy has been corrected.
     9.3.4.2. (Added-434ARW) If a crew member requires supervision, the FAAO will
     ensure an instructor of like specialty is included on the flight orders. The FAAO will not
     sign the FA unless all crewmembers listed on the FA have appropriate remarks codes. It
     is the FAAO’s responsibility to ensure the crew composition is appropriate for the
     mission requirements.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_434ARWSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2011                                                 99


      9.3.4.3. (Added-434ARW) It is the responsibility of each individual crewmember to
      confirm their Go/No-Go status prior to flight and sign off the FCIF. Each crewmember
      will also confirm their flight status listed on the FA is appropriate. Should errors or
      omissions be encountered on the FA, corrections will be made in ink and the aircraft
      commander will initial Column J, INITIALS FOR CHG, acknowledging the changes
      made.
      9.3.4.4. (Added-434ARW) The last step in the Go/No-Go process is for the both the
      OC and AC to verify completion of all Go/No-Go items for all listed crewmembers on
      the FA using PEX or the backup data. If a crewmember is in a restricted status, the OC
      and the AC will ensure an instructor of like specialty is included on the flight orders.
      After verifying the Go/No-Go items for each individual on the FA, the AC will put their
      initials in the remarks section, Block 16 of the FA. In instances where Go/No-Go
      validation can’t be verified, the AC will contact the FAAO or a shop chief for guidance.
      If the Go/No-Go item can’t be rectified, ensure the crewmember complies with any
      restrictions and, if need be, cancel the sortie.
   9.3.5. (Added-434ARW) Adding Additional Crew Members. Squadrons will make every
   effort to ensure an uncorrected FA is available to the crew prior to mission execution, but
   additional crewmembers can be added after completion of the FA. At home station, the AC
   will use the crewmember add-on checklist and PEX to validate Go/No-Go for each additional
   crewmember. For off-Station Go/No-Go validation, the AC will use the off-station
   crewmember add-on checklist, an Individual Training Summary and an Individual Data
   Summary to check the crewmembers status. If the Go/No-Go status can’t be verified, the
   additional crew member will not be allowed to fly. Once Go/No-Go validation is confirmed
   for all additional crewmembers and the FA updated in ink, the AC will sign the FA in Block
   16.
9.4. Supplementary Evaluations.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander
   to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
   9.4.1. (AMC) Document the supplementary evaluation program in the unit supplement.
   The program will consist of ground and in-flight inspections. Use the in-flight
   supplementary evaluation to validate and close informal trends, formal trends, or other
   leadership areas of concern. Supplementary Evaluations will be focused enough and of
   sufficient duration to gather data to validate trends and enable OG/CCs to fully address
   negative trends during unit SEBs.
   9.4.1. (434ARW) Supplementary evaluations are at the discretion of the commander and
   may be used to assess flight or ground issues. All assigned or attached aircrew members may
   receive supplementary evaluations. If a commander directs class monitoring for ground
   training, the class instructor will be given at least one days notice and will be debriefed on
   their performance.
   9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.

   9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
   evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
   evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   9.4.3. (AMC) As a minimum, use in-flight or ground supplemental evaluations to close
   formal trends generated in the unit trends program.
   9.4.3. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will determine the method of evaluation and
   documentation, and if corrective actions are required, will assign an OPR to conduct the
   corrective action. The effectiveness of the corrective action may be determined by another
   supplementary evaluation or other method as determined by 434 OG/OGV. Results of
   supplementary evaluations will be kept on file by 434 OG/OGV for a minimum of one year
   and added to the agenda of the next SEB.
   9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
   supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
   9.4.4. (AMC) Instructors will be used to conduct in-flight supplemental evaluations.
   9.4.4. (434ARW) Simulator contractor instructors may conduct supplementary evaluations.
   Instructors and flight examiners performing in-flight supplementary evaluations may act as
   primary crew members and perform instructor/flight examiner duties while conducting
   supplementary evaluations.
   9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
   result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
   9.4.6. At a minimum, supplementary evaluations results will be documented in SEB minutes
   (see Attachment 2).
   9.4.6. (434ARW) 434 OG/OGV will review the results of supplementary evaluations with
   the OG/CC and the commander directing the evaluation.
