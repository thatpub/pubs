This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Managing Aerospace
Equipment Maintenance. This instruction extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI)
21-101_AFRC SUP 1, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and 94th Installation
Emergency Management Plan 10-2. This instruction establishes individual responsibilities,
restrictions, and documentation requirements for responsibilities and procedures necessary for
Crash Damaged/ Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR) in the Dobbins Air Reserve Base (ARB)
area of responsibility (AOR) to include all unit equipped and transient aircraft. Squadron
commanders and maintenance supervisors are responsible for executing the group’s CDDAR
program in accordance with (IAW) this instruction. All agencies involved with recovery
operations will ensure compliance with this instruction to ensure a cooperative, coordinated
response to CDDAR situations. The 94th Maintenance Group supervisors will monitor the
CDDAR program and assist squadrons as necessary. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force
Information Management Tool (AF IMT) 847, Recommendation for Change for Publication;
route AF IMTs 847 from the field through major command (MAJCOM) publications/forms
managers. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

       hazards, including toxic materials, munitions, and radioactive materials are
       eliminated, and the aircraft and egress systems are made safe for recovery
       activities and investigation team members. Review and start the Crashed,
       Damaged, or Disabled Aircraft Recovery Team Chief Checklist. Evaluate the
       aircraft damage and prepare for recovery operations.
    2.2.18.10. Ensure complete safety briefings are given daily, detailing hazards to
    personnel and equipment. Maintain continuous communications with the MXG/CC
    and MOC to keep them informed on the progress of the recovery operation, to include
    CDDAR team limitations. Document a locally devised CDDAR daily occurrence log
    to maintain a record of incident.
    2.2.18.11. Ensure the crash recovery team members follow all applicable TOs and
    safety procedures while conducting aircraft recovery.
DOBBINSARBI21-123 7 MAY 2014                                                                    9


      2.2.18.12. Ensure all members are current in required occupational health medical
      exams. Develop and maintain respiratory protection program shop guidance. Ensure all
      crash recovery team members meet all requirements of the base respiratory protection
      program (medically cleared, fit tested, and trained.)
3. Transient/Tenant Unit Aircraft Responsibilities:
   3.1. CDDAR equipment on station is limited to assigned home station airframe.
   3.2. CDDAR team chief will contact owning organization to obtain necessary expertise and
   guidance from appropriate sources. All team members will be briefed on special
   requirements/health and safety concerns associated with transient aircraft recovery.
   3.3. All base organizations will provide assistance with transient aircraft (including civilian
   aircraft) recovery operations as directed.
      3.3.1. Clay National Guard/AASF #2 will:
          3.3.1.1. Provide a subject matter expert (SME) to advise CDDAR team during tenant
          and transient aircraft CDDAR operations.
          3.3.1.2. Provide the CDDAR team with specific T.O.s, Job Guides, or Manuals.
          3.3.1.3. Supply the equipment and personnel as needed for CDDAR operations.
      3.3.2. The Army Reserve UC-35 Detachment will:
          3.3.2.1. Provide a SME to advise CDDAR team during tenant and transient UC-35
          CDDAR operations.
          3.3.2.2. Provide the CDDAR team with UC-35 specific T.O.s, equipment and
          personnel as needed for CDDAR operations.
          3.3.2.3. Ensure contract with L-3 is current for aircraft recovery upon release from
          Army Aviation Safety Representative.
      3.3.3. Lockheed Martin will:
          3.3.3.1. Provide basic CDDAR team for Lockheed controlled aircraft that are
          identified as IFEs or GEs.
          3.3.3.2. Respond IAW the Lockheed Martin Aircraft Accident Response Plan;
          specifically sections 10.0, 11.0, and Appendices L and K.
          3.3.3.3. Provide specific T.O.s, equipment, and a SME (to include sufficient
          manpower) to advise the CDDAR team during CDDAR operations of LMCO owned
          aircraft and if necessary, recover CDDAR assets.
4. Safety Considerations:
   4.1. All 94 Base organizations must be aware of the following safety concerns present
   during crash recovery procedures.
   4.2. All organizations MUST communicate and coordinate activities through the EOC
   during recovery operations.
   4.3. Note: Operational Risk Management practices will be utilized and are paramount in all
   decision-making.

  4.4. Prior to any recovery actions ensure any hazards, including toxic materials, munitions,
  and radioactive materials are eliminated, and the aircraft and egress systems are made safe
  for recovery activities and investigation team members. All base organizations should be
  familiar      with     safety/health     hazards     associated     with     any     unique
  characteristics/hazards/materials for assigned aircraft (e.g. F-22, C-130 ballast depleted
  uranium, aircraft composite materials, etc.) and document training.
  4.5. Personnel and equipment should remain outside the Controlled Movement Area unless
  authorized by ATC Ground.
  4.6. Unmanned equipment should remain at least 200ft from taxiway edge and 100ft from
  runway edge. No equipment should be unmanned on the runway, taxiway, overrun, and in
  clear zones at the end of the runways, without prior coordination with Airfield Management.
  4.7. WARNING: Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure may cause
  serious injury or death to those in contact with it. Transient aircraft home bases and BEE
  must be contacted to determine composite material risks and requirements for personal
  protective equipment (PPE).
  4.8. CAUTION: The crash site will only be disturbed to the extent necessary to eliminate a
  situation that is detrimental to the aircraft, support equipment, or personnel. The area will be
  maintained in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is released to maintenance by the
  appropriate authority. Once recovery actions begin, only personnel designated by the
  CDDAR team supervisor will enter the recovery area.
  4.9. CAUTION: Always obtain necessary clearance for maintenance vehicles to cross
  active runways or taxiways to reach the recovery site if required.
  4.10. WARNING: Aircrew egress/ejection systems must be de-activated/de-armed/safe
  prior to start of recovery operations to prevent personnel injury.
