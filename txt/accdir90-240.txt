SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
change incorporates updated Community Action Information Board Integrated Delivery System
policy, guidance, requirements and wing-level standards detailed in the recently revised AFI 90-
501.
1. General.
    1.1. Compliance and standardization requirements lists (C&SRL) are the primary checklist
    used during Air Combat Command Inspector General (HQ ACC/IG) Unit Compliance
    Inspection (UCI) to assess unit compliance with guidance governing each particular area of
    operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ ACC staff [and Air National Guard
    (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (for associate units only) as applicable], and based
    upon existing statutory requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF and ACC
    guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG leadership to
    assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the
    C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection
    items and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and
    the mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core and
    General Compliance Items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the UCI, it
    is the intent of the evaluation team to inspect 100% of the CCOs as a minimum, that apply to
    the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the inspection.
    Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objectives. The CCO is an item or area where unit failure
       to comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or
       serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
      - Airman development programs
      - Ability to deploy forces
      - Ability to employ forces
CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). The CCI is an item or area that requires special
       vigilance and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed
       "Critical." Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission
       performance or could result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL
       CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). The GCI is an item or area deemed
       fundamental to successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would
       result in minimal impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in
       injury or possible litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
