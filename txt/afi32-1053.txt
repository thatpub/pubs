SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
updates, clarifies, and streamlines previous guidance on pest management; further emphasizes
use of integrated pest management (IPM) programs to prevent or control pest and disease
vectors; and adds new guidance on managing invasive species, using pesticides near
threatened/endangered species habitats, pesticide security and reporting, contracts, and use of
pesticides during contingency operations. This revision identifies civil engineer squadron
commander and/or installation civil engineer responsibilities. It also implements changes due to
DODI 4150.07, DOD Pest Management Program, 29 May 2008.

        commercial pest management service (including base operations support [BOS], General
        Services Administration [GSA], subcontracts, or other support service contracts that
        utilize pesticides).
        4.7.3. The CE contract management office will work with the installation contracting
        office to ensure all prospective contractors send proof that all their personnel have current

        follow the country FGS or OBEGD for pest management contract requirements or
        MAJCOM policy.
        4.7.5. The contracting officer and IPMC must approve the location where pesticides are
        mixed and/or stored prior to starting work. This site should have secondary containment
        and backflow prevention as identified in AFPMB TG No. 17. The contractor will ensure
        this area is properly managed to prevent spills.
        4.7.6. The contractor must comply with all applicable parts of Title 29, Code of Federal

Terms
Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB)—A Directorate of the Office of the Deputy
Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), the AFPMB recommends
DOD policy, provides scientific advice, and enhances coordination among DOD components on
all matters related to pest management.
Direct Supervision—Supervision that includes being at the specific location where pest
management work is conducted; providing instruction and control; and maintaining a line-of-
sight view of the work performed. Certain circumstances may temporarily remove the line-of-
sight view of the application of pesticide from the supervisor, such as topographic constraints,
vegetation constraints, or building structural constraints. Under these temporary circumstances,
the supervisor shall be responsible for the actions of the pesticide applicator.
AFI32-1053 23 JUNE 2009                                                                          23


Disease Vector—Any animal capable of transmitting the causative agent of a human disease;
serving as an intermediate or reservoir host of a pathogenic organism; or producing human
discomfort or injury, including (but not limited to) mosquitoes, flies, other insects, ticks, mites,
snails, and rodents.
Installation Pest Management Coordinator (IPMC)—Installation pest management
supervisor or natural resources manager for the installation that is designated by the installation
civil engineer (in accordance with MAJCOM guidance) to serve as the IPMC with responsibility
for developing and updating the installation pest management plan. The IPMC will also review
installation pest management contracts and the monthly pesticide use (active ingredient) reports
submitted to the MAJCOM PMC. Pesticide chemical requests will be provided to the IPMC for
review to ensure compliance with hazardous materials management.
Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP)—A plan based on ecosystem
management that describes and delineates the interrelationships of the individual natural
resources elements in concert with the mission and land use activities affecting the basic land
management plans; defines the natural resources elements and the activities required to
implement stated goals and objectives for those resources.
Integrated Pest Management (IPM)—A planned program incorporating continuous
monitoring, education, record keeping, and communication to prevent pests and disease vectors
from causing unacceptable damage to operations, people, property, materiel, or the environment.
IPM includes methods such as habitat modification, biological control, genetic control, cultural
methods, mechanical control, physical control, regulatory control, and the judicious use of least-
hazardous pesticides.
Invasive Species—An alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or
environmental harm or harm to human health (E.O. 13112).
Noxious Weed—Any plant or plant product that can directly or indirectly injure or cause
damage to crops (including nursery stock or plant products), livestock, poultry, or other interests
of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, the public health, or the environment.
Nuisance Wildlife—Wildlife that damages property, impedes installation operations, or
endangers public health and safety to the point where control measures are required. This
category excludes wildlife species protected by the Endangered Species Act or Migratory Bird
Treaty Act. All wildlife control efforts should be conducted in accordance with AFI 32-7064 and
appropriate regulatory authorities.
Pests—Arthropods, birds, rodents, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, algae, snails, marine
borers, snakes, weeds, or other organisms (except for human or animal disease-causing
organisms) that adversely affect readiness, military operations, or the well-being of personnel
and animals; attack or damage real property, supplies, equipment, or vegetation; or are otherwise
undesirable.
Pest Management Consultant (PMC)—Professional DOD pest management personnel located
at component headquarters, field operating agencies, MAJCOMs, facilities engineering field
divisions or activities, or area support activities, who provide technical and management
guidance for the conduct of installation pest management operations. Some pest management
consultants may be designated by their component as certifying officials.
24                                                               AFI32-1053 23 JUNE 2009


Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE)—A quality assurance inspector who is an Air Force
employee, trained in pest management, who protects the government’s interest through on-site
performance evaluation of commercial pest management contracts or other contracts that involve
the use of pesticides.
