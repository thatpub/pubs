This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 11-1, Flying Hour Program. This
inspection checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities and the USAFE
Supplement, inspection programs. This checklist identifies compliance items that support guidance in the
following: law, executive order, higher headquarters publication (Department of Defense (DoD), Air
Force Instruction (AFI), Air Force Manual (AFMAN), etc.) and United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE) publications. It applies to all USAFE A-10, F-15, F-15E, and F-16 operations and supports
guidance in the following: AFI 11-202 Vol 1, Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2A-OA-10 Volume 1, A/
OA-10--Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2F-15 Volume 1, F15--Aircrew Training, AFI 11-2F-15E Volume 1,
F15E-Aircrew Training, and AFI 11-2F-16 Volume 1, F16-Pilot Training. Units may create or add inter-
nal compliance items, ensure that any local publications, instructions or supplements are created in accor-
dance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management,. This checklist is intended for inspection
use, only. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Com-
mand (AFRC) units. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication on AF Form 847,
Recommendations for Change of Publication, to USAFE Operations Directorate, HQ USAFE/A3TO,
Unit 3050 Box 15, APO AE 09094. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363),
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located in AFRIMS (AF Portal).

1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection and assess-
ment. As a minimum, units should use USAFE inspection guides in conjunction with the annual Unit Self
Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
Units can supplement this publication to add internal compliance items. Users may add any item that, in
the exercise of good judgment, requires examination. This directory may be used in whole or in part by
higher headquarter (HHQ) during visits or exercises.
    1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identified by
    functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General (HQ
    USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-com-
       pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect system reliabil-
       ity. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air
       Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as significant guide items requiring direct
       IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using uppercase, and bold letters.
       1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall perfor-
       mance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance
       but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Identify CGIs by using standard
       sentence case.

2. Applicability. All items on this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code designating to
which type of unit the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following main operating bases:
Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein, and Spangdahlem. Applicability code 4 designates
Air Support Operations Group (ASOG), including associated Air Support Operations Squadron (ASOS).

3. Forms Adopted: Refer to the listed prescribing directive (PD) for guidance on the completion of the
form. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, PD: AFI 11-215.
