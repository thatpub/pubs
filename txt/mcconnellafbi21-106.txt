1. GENERAL PROCEDURES:
     1.1. The Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) Maintenance Operations Center (MOC)
     will broadcast pertinent weather information on all radio nets as soon as possible after
     notification. In addition, the MOC will notify the 22d Maintenance Group (22 MXG)/931
     Deputy Commander for Maintenance (931DCM), Maintenance Group Quality Assurance
     (MXG/QA), Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS), Transient Alert, and Maintenance
     Squadron (MXS) supervision, 22d Logistics Readiness Squadron, (22 LRS), Petroleum Oil
     Lubrication (22 LRS/POL) and 22d Civil Engineer Squadron (22 CES) when a weather
     warning/advisory is received. Requests for weather forecasts will be accepted only from
     expeditors/shop chiefs or higher.
     1.2. AMXS and MXS superintendents will use current weather information, this instruction,
     applicable tech data and their on-scene assessment to determine the proper actions to
     implement. On-scene assessment is especially important when there is lightning or rapidly
     changing weather conditions.
     1.3. Actions should be initiated according to the weather forecasted. For example, if 45-knot
     winds are expected, start preparation given in paragraph 4.2. below. If severe weather arrives
     before required actions have been completed, the safety of personnel versus the protection of
     resources will be considered prior to further action.
2. WEATHER WARNING:
     2.1. A weather warning is issued when weather condition exists that pose an immediate
     hazard to aircraft, resources or personnel.
3. WEATHER WATCH:
     3.1. A weather watch is issued when the potential exists for weather conditions that pose a
     threat to aircraft, resources or personnel. Watches normally precede a weather warning.
     3.2. The MXS production supervisor (Red 5) and the MOC will ensure that the MXS fuel
     shop are notified of all weather advisories.
     3.3. Fuel system supervisor shall initiate action to ensure operations are suspended by the
     time the severe weather is within five nautical miles.
4. CONDITIONS AND SPECIFIC PROCEDURES:
     4.1. Winds or gusts from 25 to 34 knots:
        4.1.1. Loose equipment secured.
        4.1.2. The 22 MXS AGE flight will remove KC-135R radome stand from the mass
        parking area and secure it.
        4.1.3. Secure aircraft including all doors and panels.
        4.1.4. Personnel will not use JLG or de-icer baskets for de-icing or any other
        maintenance unless otherwise approved by the MXG/CC.

     4.2.4. Non-essential flight line AGE, trailers, and equipment will be removed from the
     mass parking area and secured.
     4.2.5. The MOC, in coordination with production superintendents, determines movement
     and hangar occupancy.
         4.2.5.1. When severe weather threatens (lightning within 5 miles or winds exceeding
         34 knots), MOC personnel will notify AMXS/MXS production superintendent, who
         will ensure their respective hangar doors are closed.
     4.2.6. Open fuel system maintenance will be suspended when winds reach 30 knots due
     to potential static build-up from wind on exposed tail surface (i.e., aircraft not fully
     enclosed in a hanger).
     4.2.7. Personnel will not use JLG or de-icers for de-icing or any other maintenance.
  4.3. Winds or gusts 65 knots or more (includes tornadoes):

       4.4.2. For hail move aircraft into hangars (if not already completed).
    4.5. Electrical Storms: (Cloud to ground lightning within 5 miles).
       4.5.1. Cease all fuel cell maintenance.
       4.5.2. Enclosed hangar maintenance (other than fuel cell) may continue. Nose dock
       aircraft maintenance will stop due to the exposure of the aircraft tail to lightning strikes.
       4.5.3. All personnel not directly involved with an in-flight or ground emergency will
       take cover inside a building or an enclosed vehicle until storm passes beyond the 5-mile
       limit.
       4.5.4. Cease all electro explosive device maintenance within the flight line (squibs)

       lightning within five nautical miles. At this time the MXS fuel shop will be on work
       stoppage until all potentially severe weather within five nautical miles has expired.
       4.5.8. Non-Forecasted Weather: On duty Production Superintedents may initiate actions
       to suspend maintenance at any time he/she detects a weather hazard prior to official
       notification from weather flight. Additionally, he/she will make prompt notification to
       appropriate agencies (MOC, Red 5, Tanker, Archer, etc.)
    4.6. De-ice Preparation. See checklist (Attachment 5, 6) for de-icing procedures.
       4.6.1. The following procedures will be used to prepare for the de-icing season, which is
       from 01 November to 31 March each year.
    4.6.2. Secure aircraft including all doors and panels: install all protective covers IAW
    appropriate technical data.

    AFTO Forms781A:
       ―Verify flight control balance bays are free of snow, ice and slush accumulation prior to
       flight, IAW 1C-135A-6WC-1‖ This entry will be on a Red X symbol.
       4.6.4.1. 22 MXG/CC can waive this requirement when unseasonably warm temperatures
       do not warrant the discrepancy to be entered in the aircraft’s AFTO Form 781A.
    4.6.5. At the time of panel and inlet inspection, a qualified technician will verify the
    completion of the inspection, necessary removal of accumulation, and sign off the 781A
    entry.
MCCONNELLAFBI21-106 9 OCTOBER 2012                                                           5


     4.6.6. When aircraft are parked on the MAPA during icing conditions, flaps will be
     raised to the full-up position, horizontal stabilizer positioned 2 ½ units nose down
     position, windows closed, window covers installed.
     4.6.7. 22 CES, AMXS will operational check all de-icing equipment to ensure readiness
     by 01 November.
     4.6.8. 22 CES will ensure operability of de-icing pits each year by 15 October.
         4.6.8.1. MXS will preposition the following equipment at the de-ice pit area: five
         light carts, three H-1 heaters, three power carts, and two B-5 stands.
         4.6.8.2. AMXS will preposition the following equipment at the de-ice pit area: two
         fire bottles, and 2 sets of aircraft chocks.
     4.6.9. Personnel preparation:
         4.6.9.1. 22 OG/OGV and 22 MXG/931 DCM will coordinate a meeting to discuss
         notification procedures, aircrew alerting, and de-icing procedures prior to 01
         November.
     4.6.10. 22 MXG/CC or 931DCM/CC or his/her designated representative approval is
     required to tow aircraft when the runway condition reading (RCR) is less than 7.
  4.7. Extreme Heat. NOTE: The following is extracted from the 22 ARW policy on heat
  stress for further detail on heat stress contact Bioenvironmental Engineering, 759-5104.
     4.7.1. The Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (22 AMDS/SGPB) monitors the Wet
     Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) when there is potential for severe heat stress
     conditions. When the WBGT exceeds 85 degrees (22 AMDS/SGPB) notifies the
     Command Post. The heat stress advisory will remain in effect until 1900 hours unless
     superseded by subsequent severe weather alerts.
     4.7.2. The Command Post notifies the MOC, Transient Alert, McConnell Emergency
     Communications Center (MECC), Law Enforcement Desk, Civil Engineer Customer
     Service Desk, and the Communications Control Center. Each of these centers is
     responsible for notifying personnel under their span of control.
     4.7.3. All personnel must be alert for the signs and symptoms of heat stress, and comply
     with control methods when applicable.
         4.7.3.1. A very effective and simple means of deciding if a worker has reached
         his/her limit is through a rapid pulse rate. If a person is at risk move them to an
         indoor area 78 degrees (or cooler) and rest for at least 60 minutes. Consider
         remaining indoors for the rest of the day.
         4.7.3.2. Control methods supervisors should use to prevent heat injuries include:
            4.7.3.2.1. Provide cool, potable water and encourage consumption.
            4.7.3.2.2. Use buddy rule and allow for frequent micro breaks so workers can set
            their own pace.
            4.7.3.2.3. Educate workers on symptoms and controls; closely supervise to ensure
            understanding.

Notes:
1. Due to the physiological strain associated with Very Heavy work among less fit workers
regardless of WBGT, criteria values are not provided.
2. Table taken from ACGIH TLV handbook and converted to °F (22 AMDS/SGPB).
3. Full heat acclimatization requires up to 3 weeks of continued physical activity under heat-
stress conditions similar to those anticipated for the work. Its loss begins when the activity under
those heat-stress conditions is discontinued and a noticeable loss occurs after 4 days. With a
recent work history of heat-stress exposures (e.g. 5 of the last 7 days) a worker can be considered
acclimatized for use of this table.
