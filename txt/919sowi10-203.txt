SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates unit changes and titles. Updates terminology (Battle Staff to Crisis Action Team)
and updates paragraphs 5.7, 5.14, 7.1, 9.1 and 9.3. A margin bar (*) indicates newly revised material.
1. General. Operations during emergencies, disasters, and wartime or exercise conditions require
positive direction and rapid response to a variety of situations. To provide this command and control
element, the 919 SOW Commander will establish and may activate the Wing CAT.
2. CAT Composition. The composition of the CAT will vary depending on the nature of the situation.
The primary CAT (identified in paragraph 4) is considered the minimum necessary to begin to analyze a
situation. If warranted, the commander may require all or part of the expanded CAT (identified in
paragraph 5) to attend the initial briefing.
   2.1. The CAT will be tailored to each situation. This team will consist of functional experts who
   can provide the CAT with information and advice to support decision-making.
 2                                                                   919SOWI10-203 13 APRIL 2009


     2.2. The 919 SOW Commander will make the determination if any additional members are needed.
3. CAT Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of each CAT member to ensure an alternate is
available when the primary member is on temporary duty (TDY) away from home station (TDY, on
leave, etc). CAT members must possess at least a Secret security clearance, and will be familiar with all
actions associated with varying stages of increased readiness or emergency conditions. During an
extended crisis situation, the CAT Director will determine minimum CAT representation and establish
work shifts to sustain operations.

 4                                                                   919SOWI10-203 13 APRIL 2009

9. Security. The 919 SOW/CP is a restricted area. All personnel requesting unescorted entry into the
CAT are required to have area 13 on their AF Form 1199, Air Force Entry Control Card. Others
requesting entry into the CAT without an Area 13 must request clearance by the CATD. The CATD
will maintain a current Entry Access List (EAL), in the command post, which lists personnel authorized
entry with or without area 13 on their AF Form 1199.
     9.1. For real-world contingencies, a security guard will be posted outside the restricted area to
     control access into the command post and CAT. Entry into the restricted area will be validated with
     either the AF Form 1199 or EAL.
     9.2. Personnel not on the EAL, but with a valid need to be in the CAT or command post will be
     escorted and signed in and out on an AF Form 1109, Visitor Registers Log, after being cleared by
     CATD.
9.3. CAT personnel must follow strict Operations Security (OPSEC) and Communications Security
(COMSEC) procedures. No cellular phones, Personal Data Assistants (PDA), pagers or Blackberry
devices are allowed in the CAT. If you must bring these devices to the CAT, turn them off and leave
them in the cabinet, in the CAT main entryway. CAT members will forward or place telephones on hold
prior to briefings. Open lines are not allowed during classified briefings.
10. Control of Classified. The CAT will control classified documents by documenting all classified on
the CAT Classified Control Log (CCL). CAT members are responsible, collectively and individually,
for proper handling of classified material. Classified material signed out to runners by CAT members
will also be logged on the CCL to ensure accountability. All classified material logged on the CCL will
be returned immediately upon deactivation of the CAT.
     10.1. The EAP binders contain classified Rapid Action Checklists (RAC) that describes unit actions
     to follow during times of crisis. The command post is responsible for the currency of the RAC
     tables. Individual functional managers will provide updates when necessary. As a minimum, the
     EAP binders will be reviewed annually.
     10.2. The EAP binders are designed to store unclassified materials in addition to the classified
     material. Functional managers may need immediate access to this unclassified material during times
     of crisis. CAT members may add to the basic binder any information they deem appropriate,
     however, the member is responsible for ensuring all material added is properly marked with the
     correct classification.
11. Training. The CAT members will be briefed semi-annually on EAP. The briefings will consist of
implementation procedures and individual staff agency responsibilities for different increased readiness
919SOWI10-203 13 APRIL 2009                                                                  5


and emergency situations. The command post will facilitate these briefings. The 919 SOW
Commanders will exercise the CAT at least once each semi-annual period. This requirement may be
satisfied by a real-world contingency, a locally originated exercise, participation in a higher
headquarters-directed exercise, or an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI).
