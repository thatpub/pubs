environment during all phases of launch operations. This instruction delineates and prescribes responsi-
bilities of the 30th Space Wing (30 SW) and its subordinate units for analysis, coordination and the appli-
cation of procedures to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this instruction to 2 ROPS/DON, 1602 California Blvd, Suite 146, VAFB CA 93437-5233

       1.3.2. Responsible for evaluating all hazards generated by the operation.
       1.3.3. The focal point for all hazard analyses and actions required in the event of an operational
       mishap on base.
    1.4. The 30 Space Wing Launch Safety (30 SW/SEL) Flight Safety Analyst (FSA) will:
       1.4.1. Provide operational safety analyses, including the generation of safety plans and proce-
       dures, and the determination of hazardous areas.
       1.4.2. Require hazard and evacuation notices to be issued as necessary.
       1.4.3. Provide current hazard analyses on ships and aircraft within hazardous areas during count-
       down operations.

    matter, action, or coordination required for airspace and seaspace.

2. General Range Clearance Actions. Surveillance and clearance of land, sea, and air areas in the vicin-
ity of Western Range (WR) hazardous operations is necessary to ensure operations take place in a safe
environment.
    2.1. A base Launch Support Team (LST) provides fire fighters, medical crew, and emergency support

Terms
Restricted Area—Airspace designated under Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 73 and identified
by an area on the surface of the land or waters of a state within which the flight of an aircraft, while not
wholly prohibited, is subject to restrictions. It denotes the existence of unusual and often unobservable
hazards to aircraft. Restricted Areas are denoted by a number prefixed with an "R" (Attachment 2).
Warning Area—Specified international airspace beyond the three-mile limit within which activities may
exist constituting potential danger to aircraft. The hazard to aircraft flight in Warning Areas may be of the
same or similar nature as the hazards in Restricted Areas. Since Warning Areas are international airspace,
hazard notifications are advisory in nature and the agency creating the hazard must exercise “due regard”
for the rights and safety of others. Warning Areas are denoted by a number prefixed with a "W"
(Attachment 2).
Danger Zones—Surface Danger Zones extend three miles seaward from the shoreline along the
Vandenberg AFB coastline. They are closed for hazardous operations at frequent and irregular intervals.
For the most part, Danger Zones are open for general use unless closed by a notice issued Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 33, Section 334.1130) by the SW to local area harbormasters and the Coast Guard.
Closure notices are both sent to harbormasters and broadcast by Frontier Control.
Flight Hazard Area—That area in which significant hazard to personnel and equipment would exist in
the event of a malfunction during the early phases of flight. It is the ground and airspace extending to an
unlimited altitude and includes the entire area where the risk of serious injury, death, or substantial
property damage is so severe as to necessitate exclusion of all personnel and equipment not needed to
conduct the launch operation. Personnel required to be within this area during a launch operation must be
located within approved shelters or facilities according to Eastern and Western Range 127-1, Range
Safety Requirements.
Flight Caution Area—That ground and airspace extending to an unlimited altitude outside the Flight
Hazard Area where moderate hazards to personnel and equipment would exist because of a flight failure.
This area is restricted and only essential personnel are allowed to remain within the Flight Caution Area
during launch operations.
