SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document has been substantially revised and should be completely reviewed.



1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection/assessment.
As a minimum, units should use this directory, in conjunction with the annual Unit Self-Assessment. The
objective is to idebtify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Units can supple-
ment this publication to add internal compliance items. This directory may be used in whole or in part by
HHQ during visits or exercises. Users may add any item(s), which, in the exercise of good judgement,
requires examination.
   1.1. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO). Items defined by the ACC Staff as key result areas for
   a successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-compliance could
   result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, or litigation. BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.

    1.2. Core Compliance Items (CCI). Areas that require special vigilance and are important to the
    over-all performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical". Non-compliance would result in some
    negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury, unnecessary cost, or possible litiga-
    tion. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
    1.3. General Compliance Items (GCI). Areas deemed fundamental to successful overall perfor-
    mance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission accomplishment or
    would be unlikely to result in injury, increased cost, or possible litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence
    case format.
