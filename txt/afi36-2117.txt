   6.1. Career recruiters are assigned within AFRS according to AFI 36-2110 and subject to HQ AFPC/
   DPAA approval. The SDI 8R300s complete AFRS Form 4, Recruiter Reassignment Request, follow-
   ing the reassignment process as outlined in AFRSI 36-2101, Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS)
   Military Personnel Programs, Chapter 3. (AFRSI 36-2101 prescribes AFRS Form 4. Refer to that
   publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
   6.2. HQ AETC/A1KA posts advertisements quarterly (January, April, July, and October) on the
   assignments Web site for a minimum of 2 weeks. Career recruiters may (and are encouraged to) vol-
   unteer for as many SDI 8R300 positions as they are qualified to perform. For a list of CRF locations

   CRF%20POSITIONS.doc. Note: Locations may change due to office closures or relocations.
   6.3. Career recruiters volunteer for available assignments and compete against their peers for require-
   ments. However, reassigning career recruiters may be necessary to meet mission requirements,
   improve the recruiting market, and replace personnel losses. HQ AFRS/RSX attempts to fill 100 per-
   cent of all CRF requirements with volunteers. If there are no volunteers, HQ AFRS/RSX fills require-
   ments with qualified SDIs 8R300 based on eligibility criteria (see paragraph 4.).
   6.4. HQ AETC/A1KA confirms eligibility requirements and requests final approval.
   6.5. HQ AETC/A1KA loads assignments in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and AFPC
   approves and updates the assignment.

7. Qualifications for SDI 8R300 Duties. See AFI 36-2101 for comprehensive descriptions of required
qualifications for each position.

8. Overseas (OS) Assignments. Enlisted accessions (EA) recruiters serving in OS positions are consid-
ered priority fills. EAs serving in these positions must be in the grade of technical sergeant (TSgt) with
prior military entrance processing station (MEPS) experience in Europe, Japan, Guam, and Caribbean.
For all OS locations, go to following Web site: https://xtranet.rs.af.mil/library/HQ%20AFRS/RSX/
RSXP/RSXPP/CRF/CRF%20POSITIONS.doc.

9. Out-of-Cycle Assignments. For those unusual circumstances where a critical 8R300 vacancy must be
filled outside of the normal assignment cycle, HQ AFRS/RSX, through coordination with RCGs and divi-
sion chiefs, works with HQ AETC to expedite a qualified replacement. HQ AETC/A1KA solicits volun-
teers via the Enlisted Quarterly Assignment Listing (EQUAL) advertisement process.

10. Temporary Duty (TDY) Pending Administrative or Disciplinary Action. When a career recruiter
becomes involved in an incident or activity that may result in, or that could potentially result in, unfavor-
able publicity, the RCS/CC or RCG/CC is authorized to place the Airman in TDY status (if no other duty
alternative exists in the recruiter’s local area). Commanders must exercise caution to ensure the least
expensive duty option is used. Approval of this TDY is contingent upon the concurrence of the gaining
activity, if applicable, and the recruiting unit’s ability to fund the action.

11. Relief Action. Prior to requesting relief and reassignment of a career recruiter, commanders must
consider whether discharge action under AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, or a demo-
tion action under AFI 36-2503, Administrative Demotion of Airmen, is warranted. AFI 36-2909, Profes-
sional and Unprofessional Relationships, and AETCI 36-2909, Professional Conduct and Relationships,
include specific prohibitions on the formation of personal relationships in the recruiting environment.
AFRSI 36-2001, Recruiting Procedures for the Air Force, identifies recruiting personnel standards for
professionalism and integrity in the conduct of day-to-day business. The RCG/CCs and division chiefs
must notify HQ AFRS/RSX of any pending 8R300 relief action. Refer to AFRSI 36-2101 for specific
guidelines. AFRS/CC holds final approval authority for all recruiter relief actions. HQ AFPC has final
approval authority for AFSC removal, utilization, and reassignment actions.

12. Assignment Deferment Programs. Career recruiters applying for an assignment deferment pro-
gram; for example, high school senior deferment, humanitarian, exceptional family member request, edu-
cation, or commissioning will notify their RCS/CC, CCU, CCY, and first sergeant within 24 hours of
application submission. HQ AFPC is the final approval for all deferment requests.

13. Other Special Duty Assignments. A career recruiter can apply for other special duty assignments or
retraining out of recruiting provided he or she is released by RCG/CC.

14. CRF Badge. Career recruiters wear a distinctive CRF badge in place of the standard recruiter badge.
The CRF badge is presented to recruiters selected for SDI 8R300 duty. The CRF badge with a certificate
is presented to the recruiter at commander’s call, annual training conference, or any other appropriate rec-
ognition ceremony.

15. CRF Development. Progression for career recruiters is important for the individual and HQ AFRS.
SDI 8R300 progression within the CRF consists of Tier 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D positions (see Figure 1.).
Note: Only master sergeant (MSgt) and MSgt-selects can career progress to Tier 3B positions.
    15.1. Tier 3A Positions:
AFI36-2117 4 OCTOBER 2007                                                                              7


     15.1.1. Overseas (OS) Recruiter. These are selective positions in Europe, Japan, Guam, and the
     Caribbean. With rare exceptions, entry level is TSgt with MEPS liaison supervisor experience
     mandatory.
     15.1.2. EA Flight Chief. Entry level for EA flight chief is TSgt or MSgt. The SDIs 8R300 may
     request (or be nominated for) a lateral move within Tier 3A. MSgts are given assignment prioriti-
     zation.
     15.1.3. Officer Accessions (OA) Flight Chief. Entry level for OA flight chief is TSgt or MSgt
     with OA experience. The SDIs 8R300 may request (or be nominated for) a lateral move within
     Tier 3A. The MSgts are given assignment prioritization.
  15.2. Tier 3B Positions:
     15.2.1. These positions must be selectively manned MSgt or senior master sergeant (SMSgt) posi-
     tions with flight chief experience.
     15.2.2. Positions are filled based on RCG/CC or division chief recommendation on the AFRS
     Form 4.
     15.2.3. Recruiters who are not selected for career progression to Tier 3C may be submitted for lat-
     eral moves based on RCG/CC or division chief recommendations on an AFRS Form 4.
     15.2.4. Recruiters who are not recommended for lateral moves have the option to:
         15.2.4.1. Volunteer for Tier 3A assignments if recommended by RCG/CC or division chief.
         15.2.4.2. Apply for a special duty assignment or retraining.
         15.2.4.3. Separate or retire.
  15.3. Tier 3C Positions:
     15.3.1. Production Superintendent (CCY). AFRS depends upon highly qualified experienced
     SMSgts and SMSgt-selectees as CCYs to successfully accomplish its mission. Qualified recruiters
     in SDI 8R300 are eligible to volunteer. In assessing a recruiter’s qualifications for selection as a
     candidate, duty performance as reflected in evaluation reports, breadth of recruiting experience,
     professional military education (PME), and civilian education are considered. Although the above
     factors are not all inclusive, they do form the foundation for recommendation as a candidate for a
     CCY position. Selection as a qualified candidate does not guarantee the recruiter will fill a CCY
     vacancy. Projected vacancies are advertised by the EQUAL process.
         15.3.1.1. Responsibilities:
            15.3.1.1.1. AFRS/CC provides guidance on the CCY nomination process and approves
            CCY board results.
            15.3.1.1.2. Division chiefs and RCG/CCs identify and recommend SDI 8R300 SMSgts
            (or SMSgt-selectees) for CCY candidate list.
            15.3.1.1.3. CCUs will personally notify each eligible SDI 8R300 if recommended or not
            recommended for CCY consideration.
            15.3.1.1.4. HQ AFRS/RSX publishes guidance on the CCY selection process and notifies
            HQ AETC/A1KA to advertise CCY positions that need to be advertised.
8                                                                      AFI36-2117 4 OCTOBER 2007


           15.3.1.2. Nomination and Selection Procedures. Division chiefs and RCG/CCs should
           encourage all 8R300 SMSgts (or SMSgt-selectees) to vie for consideration; however, they
           should only identify and endorse those who currently possess the capability, leadership, and
           desire to immediately assume this key senior enlisted leadership position.
              15.3.1.2.1. Each eligible recruiter declares his or her intent on an AFRS Form 4. The RCS/
              CC endorses and forwards the form to the RCG/CC for concurrence or nonconcurrence.
              The appropriate CCU notifies the eligible candidate if recommended or not recommended.
              15.3.1.2.2. The division chief’s or RCG/CC’s endorsement completes the CCY intent pro-
              cess. The AFRS Form 4 is forwarded to HQ AFRS/RSXU and a copy is given to the RCS/
              CC. Note: The RCGs and division chiefs may submit a nonvolunteer, career recruiter for
              CCY duties.
              15.3.1.2.3. The CCY selection panel convenes each November (as needed) to recommend
              qualified candidates for AFRS/CC approval. The command chief (AFRS/CCC) chairs this
              panel with division CCUs, RCG/CCUs, and the AFRS Recruiting Career Field Manager
              seated as voting members (and any others as directed by AFRS/CC). A recorder is pro-
              vided by HQ AFRS/RSX.
