     augmented MAJCOM supplement.
2.4. Numbered Air Forces.
     2.4.1. General. NAF stan/eval (MAJCOM stan/eval when no NAF stan/eval exists) will
     maintain a tactical focus and perform the operational role in evaluating unit stan/eval
     functions within its chain of command.
     2.4.1. (AMC) General. HQ AMC/A3V assumes responsibility for functions in paragraph
     2.4 (Exception: HQ AFRC maintains NAF functions as noted.) HQ AFRC NAF/A3V
     evaluators may administer evaluations (initial, recurring, SPOT, N/N, etc.) according to the
     following restrictions. With Chief of NAF/A3V prior coordination, NAF evaluators may
     conduct observations or SPOT evaluations on any AFRC MDS or aircrew member within
     their NAF. For SPOT evaluations in a MDS or crew position in which the evaluator is not
     qualified, the evaluation is restricted to areas listed under GENERAL in the respective AFI
     11-2MDS Vol 2. At the request of the OG/CC and with the concurrence of the NAF/A3V,
     AFRC HQ/NAF/A3V evaluators may administer evaluations (see paragraph 2.4.2.6 for
     pyramid evaluation requirements) in the MDS for which they maintain qualification.
     2.4.2. Functions. The NAF stan/eval function will:
        2.4.2.1. Maintain oversight of evaluation functions in lower echelon units, in gained
        units, and in AFRC/ANG units for which oversight responsibility is assigned.
        2.4.2.2. Conduct stan/eval visits IAW MAJCOM supplements/directives.
        2.4.2.2. (AMC) AFRC/NAFs may conduct SAVs at the request of the OG/CC or at the
        direction of the NAF/A3.
        2.4.2.3. Coordinate on and process applicable AF Forms 847:

        2.4.2.3.3. For MQFs IAW paragraph 2.3.2.7.2.
     2.4.2.4. Provide staff coordination and control of all Flight Crew Information File (FCIF)
     items issued from the NAF level to units IAW paragraph 9.1.
     2.4.2.5. Provide qualified flight examiners to augment other MAJCOM and NAF
     agencies when requested (see paragraph 2.3.5).
     2.4.2.5. (AMC) AFRC/NAF provide qualified flight examiners to augment other
     MAJCOM and NAF agencies, AMC ASEVs and mid term SAVs when requested (see
     paragraph 2.3.5)
     2.4.2.6. Administer periodic flight evaluations, when practical, to Chiefs of Stan/Eval or
     senior stan/eval crews in lower echelon units, in gained units, and in AFRC/ANG units
     for which oversight responsibility is assigned.
     2.4.2.6. (AMC) Pyramid Evaluation Program. HQ AMC/A3V will implement a
     pyramid evaluation system. Senior OG/OGV evaluators (including AFRC and ANG) or
     equivalent will receive a pyramid evaluation from HQ AMC/A3V to satisfy the 17-month
     periodic qualification requirement. HQ AFRC NAF/A3V personnel do not administer
     pyramid evaluations, unless requested by HQ AMC/A3V with prior coordination of
     AFRC/A3V. Units without MDS representation at HQ AMC/A3V do not receive HQ
     AMC/A3V flight evaluations unless directed by HQ AMC/A3. When HQ AMC flight
     examiners are not available to administer pyramid evaluations to AMC-gained AFRC
     evaluators, HQ AFRC/A3V (primary) or HQ AFRC NAF/A3V (secondary) will provide
     a flight examiner for the evaluation prior to a wing level flight examiner being scheduled
     to administer the evaluation.
        2.4.2.6.1. (Added-AMC) If there are no specific aircrew or aircraft representation at
        the pyramid level, then the next higher level is responsible. The senior evaluators for
        specific aircraft and missions receive evaluations from any appropriately qualified
        examiners when there are no qualified examiners in the pyramid above them.
        2.4.2.6.2. (Added-AMC) When a HQ AMC examiner is not available to perform a
        pyramid evaluation, examiner’s will annotate in the remarks section of the AF Form 8
        that the evaluation satisfies the requirement of the pyramid evaluation per prior
        coordination with HQ AMC A3V. Include the HQ AMC evaluator’s name. For
        AFRC crewmembers the statement should also include HQ AFRC/3V coordination
        i.e. per coordination with HQ AMC/A3V, (Rank and Name) and HQ AFRC/A3V
        (Rank and Name) this evaluation satisfies the requirement for a pyramid evaluation.
        Exception: Pyramid evaluation is not required for aircrew undergoing aircraft
        conversion, difference training on aircraft or for students completing formal
        qualification and training programs according to AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1.
        2.4.2.6.3. (Added-AMC) Units may align Stan/Eval crewmembers’ qualification
        expiration dates to allow all crew positions eligible for their pyramid evaluations to
        complete the checkride at the same time.
        2.4.2.6.4. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3V may perform a staff assistance visit (SAV)
        in conjunction with pyramid evaluations when specifically requested by the unit.
     2.4.2.7. Observe execution of unit missions and provide feedback when feasible.

        2.4.2.7. (AMC) At the direction of the HQ AFRC NAF/A3, NAF A3V personnel may
        observe AFRC unit missions and provide feedback to HQ AFRC NAF/A3 or HQ
        AMC/A3V, as appropriate. Spot and No-Notice evaluations may be administered.
        Comply with the requirements of paragraph 2.3.2.13.1
        2.4.2.8. Review and coordinate on subordinate unit supplements to operational
        procedures, flying guidance and this instruction.
        2.4.2.8. (AMC) AFRC NAF/A3V will coordinate on unit local supplements and
        forward to HQ AFRC/A3V prior to approval by HQ AMC/A3.
        2.4.2.9. Review subordinate unit Stan/Eval Board (SEB) minutes and, at a minimum,
        address any action items requiring HHQ assistance.
        2.4.2.9. (AMC) AFRC NAF/A3V will address ARC specific issues in subordinate units.
        2.4.2.10. Assist MAJCOMs in the creation, review, updating and distribution of required
        MQFs. NAFs will coordinate on unit submissions to correct deficiencies to MQFs.
        Utilize AF Form 847 or submit as directed by lead MAJCOM.
        2.4.2.11. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will consolidate and analyze data from aircrew
        trends by MDS, crew position, and AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet, area.
        Provide an electronic copy (.doc file) of trend information to HQ AMC/A3V (and HQ
        AFRC/A3V for AFRC units) semi-annually for consideration to be incorporated in the
        command’s aircrew SII Program. Along with the trend information, OGV will include
        any problems requiring HQ AMC assistance and a list of open AF IMTs 847 being
        coordinated above the wing level. Note: This reporting requirement is exempt from
        licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports
        Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force
        Information Collections.
     2.4.3. Organization. Typical NAF stan/eval staff includes a section chief and one flight
     examiner per crew position per MDS. Manning for NAF flight examiner positions may be
     adjusted by the NAF Commander.
        2.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AFRC/NAF flight examiners will maintain flying
        proficiency (evaluator status) and should maintain full mission ready status. They should
        also be qualified or certified in as many special missions as possible. Special missions
        include receiver air refueling (AR), airdrop, joint precision airdrop system (JPADS),
        special operations air refueling (SOAR), etc. HQ AMC/HQ AFRC flight examiners are
        not required to maintain special mission currency according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
        Aircrew Training, and the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1; but they should
        have initial qualification in the specific special mission and participate as an examiner or
        observer on at least one special mission every 6-months.
     2.4.4. Augmentation. Each NAF may use qualified augmentees from other NAFs to
     support or conduct stan/eval aircrew evaluations and inspections with concurrence of all the
     NAF stan/eval organizations involved.
2.5. Stan/Eval Visits. HHQ stan/eval staffs may visit units during the administration of formal
inspections, Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) or in an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM
supplements.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                             17


  2.5.1. (Added-AMC) Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Visit (ASEV):
     2.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Purpose. ASEVs are the principal tool for evaluating aircrew
     flight operations and verifying safe and effective mission accomplishment. This is
     achieved through aircrew testing and flight evaluations to ensure compliance with
     approved operational procedures and applicable special interest items. Additionally, the
     effectiveness of unit aircrew Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and Aviation Resource
     Management programs are evaluated to ensure compliance and standardization among
     flying units, and provide meaningful feedback to unit commanders.
        2.5.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC ASEV teams may request augmentation from
        units or user-commands. The HQ AFRC NAF/A3Vs should augment teams for
        ASEV on their respective AFRC units, and may be asked to augment any ASEV
        team. AFRC augmentee support will be coordinated through HQ AFRC/A3V.
     2.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) ASEV Testing. ASEV team will administer a closed book
     examination to all available personnel, in the grade of O-5 and below, who are qualified
     to fly unsupervised in unit aircraft. All aircrew attached at the wing or below will test.
     Test individuals who are dual MDS aircraft qualified in only their primary aircraft. The
     ASEV examinations may be used to satisfy recurring closed book testing requirements
     for flight evaluations.
        2.5.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Tests will be derived from a minimum of 85%
        MQF questions, with the balance coming from Flight Publications,
        Safety/Operational Supplements, FCIFs, and local directives.
        2.5.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) ASEV tests have minimum passing scores according to
        requirements for closed book examinations in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Crewmembers
        failing ASEV closed book tests will be placed in supervised status until successful
        completion of unit closed book exams.
            2.5.1.2.2.1. (Added-AMC) The ASEV team will report the names of individuals
            tested and their scores to the unit commander. The final ASEV report will list the
            average of test scores by crew position and the overall average test score.
            2.5.1.2.2.2. (Added-AMC) The ASEV team chief may elect to send the ASEV
            test after formal ASEV notification but before arrival of the ASEV team. In this
            case, the unit will identify a ―
                                           trusted agent‖ to control the ASEV test content and
            conduct unit testing, or as specified by ASEV team chief.
     2.5.1.3. (Added-AMC) Primary ASEV Flight Evaluations. HQ AMC flight examiners
     will administer in-flight evaluations to senior OG (or equivalent) Stan/Eval personnel for
     each of the unit's assigned mission or design aircraft.
        2.5.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) Do not extend the senior Stan/Eval crewmember's
        evaluation expiration date to allow evaluation during the ASEV.
        2.5.1.3.2. (Added-AMC) If any senior Stan/Eval crewmembers are scheduled to
        change within 3 months following ASEV, administer evaluations to designated
        replacements.
        2.5.1.3.3. (Added-AMC) Pyramid evaluations received within 6 months before the
        start of an ASEV will count towards the ASEV in-flight evaluation requirements.
18                      AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        2.5.1.3.4. (Added-AMC) ASEV Simulator Evaluations. HQ AMC flight examiners
        may evaluate crew members in the applicable training device (if available). The
        evaluation will include all activity required for a Simulator evaluation.
        2.5.1.3.5. (Added-AMC) For KC-10 senior boom operator, use Boom Operator
        Trainer (SIM/BOT). In addition, a KC-10 CCTS instructor crew will be administered
        a SIM/BOT evaluation. Credit each SIM/BOT evaluation for one flight evaluation.
     2.5.1.4. (Added-AMC) Secondary ASEV Flight Evaluations:
        2.5.1.4.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC flight examiners will administer flight
        evaluations to instructors (preferably performing instructor duties) or flight examiners
        (preferably performing flight examiner or instructor duties). Additionally, ASEV
        team members may administer evaluations to any crewmember that is current and
        qualified to fly in unit aircraft and is on the flying schedule. Complete an AF Form 8,
        Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, for all ASEV evaluations. The total number of
        evaluations will be at the discretion of the ASEV team chief.
        2.5.1.4.2. (Added-AMC) Credit may be taken for ASEV evaluations on local and
        off-station SPOT evaluations administered by HQ AMC flight examiners on AMC-
        directed deployment, re-deployment, airlift, AR, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability
        Training (JA/ATT), JOSAC, operational and local training missions within 90 days of
        the designated start date of the ASEV. OG/CC approval is required when conducting
        local or JA/ATT evaluations before the scheduled ASEV for ANG and AFRC
        mobility units.
     2.5.1.5. (Added-AMC) ASEV Requirements:
        2.5.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Scheduling/Notification. AMC ASEV teams will
        normally visit units approximately every 40 months for unit-equipped active duty
        units and approximately every 60 months for unit-equipped ANG and AFRC units.
        Associate unit (active duty and ARC) visits will be the same frequency (and usually
        concurrent) with their unit-equipped host unit. Official unit ASEV notification will
        be sent to the unit not less than 90 days prior to the scheduled visit. The notification
        message will include ASEV team composition, transportation requirements, special
        interest items, and other details of the visit. Initial planning dates for unit ASEVs are
        coordinated with AFRC and NGB IG and A3V counterparts, and are published semi-
        annually in the AMC/IG Command-Wide Inspection Schedule and posted on the
        AMC/A3V website. Unit scheduling conflicts should be reported to HQ AMC/A3VS
        for resolution; all changes will be coordinated with the respective MAJCOM, with
        final approval by HQ AMC/A3
        2.5.1.5.2. (Added-AMC) Flight evaluations should represent a cross section of the
        unit's operational mission. Instructors may be asked to demonstrate maneuvers to help
        assess instructor ability. All crewmembers (to include AECM where applicable) may
        be asked to accomplish specific tasks or maneuvers for their crew qualification to
        assess proficiency. ASEV flight evaluations may be administered up to and including
        90 days prior to the beginning of the ASEV.
        2.5.1.5.3. (Added-AMC) ASEV teams will complete all AF IMTs 8 for in-flight
        evaluations before departure. At the unit commander’s discretion, and with ASEV
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                             19


        evaluator’s approval, evaluations administered by ASEV flight examiners may be
        credited toward periodic evaluation requirements. This request must be made prior to
        the start of the evaluation. Complete remaining ground items within 2 months (AFRC
        and ANG units may use entire eligibility period for the accomplishment of requisites)
        but not later than the end of the eligibility period. For evaluations graded Q-3 refers
        to paragraph 5.2.7.3.2
     2.5.1.6. (Added-AMC) ASEV Grading. A unit-level overall ASEV grade will be
     awarded. At the conclusion of the visit, the ASEV team chief will provide feedback (oral
     or written) to the unit commander and staff. In addition, HQ AMC/A3 or designated
     representative will release an ASEV written report following review/endorsement. ASEV
     teams will identify those areas not in compliance with current guidelines and include as
     ―required improvements‖. Units will report corrective action to AMC/A3V within 90
     days after receiving the final report. This report will be in the form of an official
     memorandum signed by the unit’s operations group commander to HQ AMC/A3V. It
     will provide specifics on what corrective action was taken to resolve each of the
     ―required improvements‖ to bring each of the designated areas into compliance.
     2.5.1.7. (Added-AMC) ASEV Programs. All unit Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and
     Aircrew Resource Management System programs are subject to inspection. The
     AMC/A3V ASEV Standards Guide provides additional information and guidance on
     specific programs subject to assessment by the ASEV team. Individual programs will be
     awarded a grade using the following scale:
        2.5.1.7.1. (Added-AMC) Outstanding: Program exceeds all requirements with no
        significant discrepancies.
        2.5.1.7.2. (Added-AMC) Excellent: Program exceeds most requirements with few
        deviations noted.
        2.5.1.7.3. (Added-AMC) Satisfactory: Program meets requirements with some
        deviations noted.
        2.5.1.7.4. (Added-AMC) Marginal: Program meets most requirements with
        significant discrepancies noted.
        2.5.1.7.5. (Added-AMC) Unsatisfactory: Major discrepancies noted that degrade
        program effectiveness.
     2.5.1.8. (Added-AMC) ASEV Results. Approved unit ASEV Reports are posted on HQ
     AMC/A3V website.
  2.5.2. (Added-AMC) Staff Assistance Visits.
     2.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V (AFRC/A3V for AFRC Units) will conduct
     scheduled Mid Term ASEV Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) at the approximate half-way
     point between ASEVs. Notification of the SAV will be sent to the unit approximately 45
     days prior. SAVs may include any Stan/Eval or training related area the unit requests.
     2.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V will normally not conduct a SAV in the 6 month
     period prior to a stan/eval inspection.

        3.2.2.4.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.4.1. (AMC) Include the following areas in trend analysis (if available):
        open/closed book examination program, evaluations, supplementary evaluation
        program, supervisory observations, and ATS contractor feedback.
        3.2.2.4.2. For units with more than one type of aircraft, combine discrepancies
        common to all aircraft/aircrews to determine trends (e.g., instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.4.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs)/Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and qualified/instructor aircrews.
        3.2.2.4.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR); report trends and status to the
        OG/CC during the SEB until closed. OGV will publish and define the trend program
        in the unit supplement to this instruction and maintain trend data for at least one year.

        knowledge of developing trends that could adversely affect the squadron’s
        operational capabilities, and provides feedback to Operations Support Training (OST)
        and Squadron, Training (Sq/DOT) on the effectiveness of their training programs.
            3.2.2.4.4.1. (Added-MACDILL) Flight evaluation trends. Report a negative
            trend from flight evaluations if 33 percent or more were downgraded in the same
            sub area. Report a positive trend if 33 percent or more were positively
            highlighted in the same sub area. Navigators (NAV), Flight Engineers (FE),
            Communications System Operators (CSO), and Flight Attendants (FA) will
            identify a trend based on a minimum of four individuals observed during the two
            previous quarters. All other crew positions will identify a trend based on a
            minimum of four individuals observed during the previous quarter.
            3.2.2.4.4.2. (Added-MACDILL) Supervisory              observation/supplemental
            evaluation trends. Sq/DOVs, Commanders (CC), and Director of Operations
            (DO) may subjectively determine that a trend exists from their ―    supervisory
            observations‖ of the daily performance of crews. These trends should conform to
            the 11-2MDS-Specific, Vol. 2 flight evaluation sub areas. Supplemental
            evaluations may be combined with this subjective method of determining trends.
            3.2.2.4.4.3. (Added-MACDILL) Testing will be included in the trends program.
            At the end of each quarter, the testing program monitor will analyze all questions
            missed and will identify any areas of concern or topics to emphasize. A question
            will be reported as a trend if it is tested a minimum of four times in the quarter
            and missed 33 percent of the time.

        evaluators, Flight/CCs, or the Sq/DO may recommend an instructor for evaluator
        certification. OG/CC is the final authority for OGV evaluators and Sq/CCs are the final
        authority for squadron evaluators. Before designation and certification as an evaluator,
        each candidate will complete the Flight Examiner Certification & Training Requirements
        (Attachment 12) (Added). SELOs will complete the SELO Training Requirements
        (Attachment 13) (Added). Completed checklists will be filed with the respective
        Sq/DOV office. Once the evaluator candidate has completed all prerequisites, an R&C
        will be conducted which will include an evaluation philosophy interview with the
        squadron commander (N/A for individuals listed in paragraph 3.3.2.10.2.4. (Added-
        AMC)).
     4.2.6. For AFRC and ANG units:
        4.2.6.1. The Air Force advisor may be designated as a flight examiner.
        4.2.6.2. Air Technician (AT)/Air Reserve Technician (ART) /Active Guard and Reserve
        (AGR) serving in a military position that does not require maintaining mission
        ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as a flight examiner.
        4.2.6.3. (Added-AMC) For AFRC and ANG units, one alternate flight examiner may be
        designated to administer flight evaluations in the absence of the senior evaluator.
        4.2.6.4. (Added-AMC) Associate units establish an OG Stan/Eval under the OG/CC or
        equivalent. The duties and responsibilities associated with Host Wing OG Stan/Eval
        apply except the Host OGV manages common areas for both Host and Associate Wings
        or Squadrons, e.g., Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB), and
        requisite examinations. This does not preclude the Associate OGV from managing
        Associate unit-unique FCIFs or developing examinations to meet unit requirements.
        4.2.6.5. (Added-AMC) All Air Technician/Active Guard Reserve (AT/AGR) and Air
        Reserve Technicians (ART) may be flight examiner qualified. ART personnel should
        occupy senior evaluator positions. For all aircrew positions, when a non-technician fills a
        Stan/Eval Unit Manning Document (UMD) position, units may assign a technician in that
        crew position to the Stan/Eval division. In this case, the technician will assume the duties
        of the senior evaluator for that crew position and may administer all evaluations.
        4.2.6.6. (Added-AMC) AFRC OG flight examiners may evaluate aircrew counterparts
        in both their OG and host active duty OG.
4.3. Functions. Flight Examiners:
     4.3.1. Conduct flight and EP evaluations as required.
     4.3.2. Maintain qualification as instructors. EXCEPTION: Not required for senior flight
     examiners.
     4.3.3. Maintain MR/CMR status as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1 AFIs,
     MDS XX - Aircrew Training. EXCEPTIONS: FTU, HHQ, senior flight examiners, and
     HHQ-designated test/evaluation units must maintain at least Basic Mission Capable (BMC)
     status.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                37


  4.3.4. Administer evaluations only within their aircrew specialty/weapon system and will
  only evaluate those missions in which they maintain qualification. EXCEPTION: SPOT
  evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2.
  MAJCOMs may establish procedures for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside
  of NAF/unit.
  4.3.4. (AMC) Unit-level flight examiners will only administer SPOT evaluations within
  their respective MDS and crew position unless directed by OG/CC.
  4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
  and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
  4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
  (this applies to all aircrew members). If this situation occurs, the flight examiner will also
  debrief unit supervision, as designated in the unit supplement, and if appropriate, document
  the deviation on an AF Form 8/8a.
     4.3.6.1. (Added-AMC) The flight examiner normally does not assume the examinee's
     position for unsatisfactory performance. If warranted, the flight examiner may assume the
     duties of that crew member, if current and qualified. Advise the crew and assume full
     responsibility for the crew position for the rest of the mission leg. In the mobility system,
     evaluators will notify the mission execution authority immediately and coordinate follow-
     on action (replacement, if required). The evaluator should be prepared to continue follow-
     on missions if directed by the execution authority.
     4.3.6.2. (Added-AMC) If, in the examiner's judgment, the examinee can continue safely
     (under supervision) the flight examiner should not assume the examinee's duties.
     4.3.6.3. (Added-AMC) Flight examiners performing in-flight duties and not qualified
     and current for the crew position in which unsatisfactory performance is observed (non-
     specialty) will inform the aircraft commander immediately.
  4.3.7. Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and flight
  commander whenever Qualification Level 2 or 3 (―Q-2‖ or ―
                                                          Q-3‖) performance is observed.
  4.3.7. (AMC) When a flight examiner observes less than Qualification Level ―           Q-1‖
  performance from any crew-member not being evaluated, the flight examiner will consult
  with appropriate qualified personnel and (through the Chief, OGV) will complete a follow-on
  recommendation for appropriate action to the unit commander (e.g., commander directed
  downgrade, follow-on N/N evaluation, additional training, etc.). The unit commander will
  determine the final course-of-action in accordance with ―  commander-directed downgrade‖
  procedures.
  4.3.8. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
  requested by the MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
  MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examiner.
  4.3.8. (AMC) Active duty and Reserve OG/OGV flight examiners may evaluate aircrew
  counterparts in both their OG and their Associate OG. Squadron or Detachment Flight
  examiners may administer evaluations outside their unit, with the approval of the examinee's
  squadron commander.

     4.3.9. (Added-AMC) Formal Training Units (FTU)/CCTS evaluators may evaluate AMC
     and AMC-gained aircrew members at formal schools or as augmentees to ASEVs.
     4.3.10. (Added-AMC) For en route evaluations, flight examiner pilots may, at their
     discretion, serve as an augmented crewmember during evaluations, but should not occupy a
     pilot seat for takeoff and landing.
4.4. Senior Flight Examiner Program.
     4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary
     assigned aircraft. Vice commanders and deputies may perform this function if the principal
     incumbent is not qualified or available.
     4.4.2. NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and OG/CDs that fly different aircraft from the OG/CC in multi-
     MDS wings, do not require, nor do they have to maintain, instructor certification or
     MR/CMR status. To become a flight examiner, NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and applicable OG/CDs,
     must maintain BMC status and be flight examiner certified. For other than SPOT evaluations,
     Senior Flight Examiners will evaluate only events for which they are current and at a level
     for which they are qualified.
4.5. Requirement. Aircrew positions that do not require a flight phase evaluation do not
require flight examiners.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                               39


                                          Chapter 5

                                       EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification
evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8/8a to ensure
aircrew qualification. EPEs are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations.
Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure
standardization of flying and other operations.
   5.1.1. (Added-MACDILL) Scheduling. Sq/DOVs are responsible for tracking evaluation
   currencies on all assigned and attached aircrew members. Each Sq/DOV will coordinate all
   scheduled flight evaluations with squadron scheduling. Boom operators on a deployment (to
   include deployment/re-deployment legs) that do not possess a current cargo qualification will
   not load/unload cargo unsupervised, and will be accompanied by any boom operator with a
   current cargo check. Boom operators with expired mission cargo evaluations are considered
   non-mission ready for handling all cargo and passengers.
   5.1.2. (Added-MACDILL) Each Sq/DOV will notify all applicable crewmembers via
   email when they enter the 6-month eligibility period. Every effort should be made to
   complete testing by the end of the third month of eligibility and the in-flight portion of the
   evaluation by the end of the fourth month. Individuals failing to complete requisite
   examinations by the fourth month of eligibility or the in-flight portion of the evaluation by
   the fifth month will be brought to the attention of the Sq/CC.
   5.1.3. (Added-MACDILL) All crewmembers will complete the requisite examinations
   prior to their periodic flight evaluation. The squadron commander may grant exceptions on a
   case-by-case basis.
5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two
structured phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The
ground phase, when required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an
inflight or, if applicable, simulator evaluation of aircrew performance. EXCEPTION: For
specialized aircrew qualified IAW Universal Qualification guidance see paragraph 5.2.18.
   5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are five types of aircrew
   qualification evaluations. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are administered to
   ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member (QUAL),
   qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM, when applicable)
   and qualification to employ the MDS of the aircrew member in accomplishing the unit’s
   operational mission (MSN). Evaluations are accomplished to ensure aircrew are certified and
   maintain instructor qualification (INSTR). Evaluation and certification of specific aircrew
   performance may also be accomplished (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types
   of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
       5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in
       their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI
       11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
40                       AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


     5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations. All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally
     with the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualification.
     EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI 11-401,
     Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft pilots;
     USAFA T-41 and T-51 pilots. Note: Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be
     assigned to other aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification in
     non-excepted aircraft. To obtain/maintain instrument qualification, pilots must
     successfully complete a periodic INSTM evaluation.
        5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under
        his/her command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke
        an instrument qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the
        procedures in Chapter 7 for a commander-directed downgrade.
        5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as a
        pilot in aircraft in which instrument qualification is required except in a training
        program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in supervised
        status. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed in paragraph 5.2.1.2)
     5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
     aircrew status will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft,
     to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the
     performance of normal operational and training sorties. The requirement for a MSN
     evaluation may be waived for those aircraft where performance of normal operational,
     test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM
     and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. QUAL and
     MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. Aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in a
     particular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional
     capability in that MDS aircraft. Specialized qualified, universally qualified, or multiple
     qualified aircrew maintaining instructor qualification in multiple similar aircraft will
     accomplish initial and periodic evaluations as specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
        5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the aircrew
        member must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation.
        Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever
        possible. When students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator may
        serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
        5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be
        conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description for these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as
        the AF Form 8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest
        qualification demonstrated during the previous evaluation (e.g. IB, IN, IP).
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                                  41


         5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained
         through an instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2 and
         5.2.3.2.4) as directed in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1.
         5.2.1.4.4. (Added-AMC) The flight evaluator will determine the evaluatee's seat
         position (normally right seat) for the initial instructor pilot evaluation and will include
         a minimum of one approach and landing.
     5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an
     evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g., INSTM,
     QUAL, MSN or INSTR). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements,
     unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as a SPOT
     evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all
     required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval and the examinee
     subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the
     periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the
     requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs
     with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves
     the additional flight time requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1
     5.2.1.4 will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the flight examiner
     administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the MDS and same crew position of
     the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.1.5. (AMC) SPOT Evaluations. Examinee must receive notification before entering
     pre-mission or pre-departure crew rest. The unit's (90-day prior) ASEV notification
     message satisfies this requirement. Crewmembers should not receive more than one
     SPOT evaluation per calendar year. EXCEPTION: As directed by the commander, or as
     directed by AMC/A3V to meet ASEV evaluation requirements.
  5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying
  resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
  designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8, e.g., QUAL/MSN or
  INSTM/QUAL/MSN. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM
  supplements.
  5.2.2. (AMC) Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. If in-flight evaluations (e.g.
  QUAL and MSN) cannot be completed within the same calendar month, use a separate AF
  FORM 8 with a separate expiration date or as specified in AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used,
  when applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.5:
     5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
     qualification in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a flight
     recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.9 for ground
     rechecks), or loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade.
42                      AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
        evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
        evaluation. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an
        RQ prefix. Note: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure
        to complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4), the
        flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period for an
        in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2
        for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, and the OG/CC determines that
        qualification will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-
        accomplishment of the flight evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in
        paragraph 5.2.16, the AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will not be
        documented with an RQ prefix.
        5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
        will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those
        items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check
        description will be documented with RQ SPOT. See also AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
        Aircrew Training, for policy regarding loss of currency.
        5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the
        recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13 The AF Form
        8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT,
        as applicable.
        5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 7.4.8), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The
        AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or
        RQ SPOT, as applicable.
        5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
        qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
        5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner
     and may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The intent is to preclude
     extraordinary preparation for the mission.
        5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
            5.2.3.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) N/N In-flight Evaluation Program. Each level of
            command (SQ/OG/AMC) will execute a N/N program. Develop the N/N program
            as an assessment tool for overall unit readiness and to provide indicators for
            appraisal and re-focusing unit training programs. OG and SQ levels will develop
            and publish a program to sample a combined minimum goal of 15% of available
            (qualified to perform aircrew duties) crewmembers (by crew position) annually. If
            a unit has less than five crewmembers in a given crew position, N/N goal is at the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                               43


          commander’s discretion.
          5.2.3.3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Crewmembers will not receive more than one N/N
          evaluation per calendar year except as directed by their commander. This
          restriction does not affect HQ AMC or AFRC/NAF evaluators conducting N/N
          evaluations in the mobility system or SPOT evaluations in conjunction with unit
          ASEV requirements. Evaluators in the mobility system may conduct only one
          N/N evaluation per crew-member (maximum) per mission.
          5.2.3.3.1.3. (Added-AMC) Avoid administering N/N evaluations within the
          eligibility period unless commander directed.
          5.2.3.3.1.3. (MACDILL) If a commander directs a no-notice evaluation of an
          individual who is in their eligibility period, the provisions of paragraph 5.2.3.3.2.
          apply. If the commander directs an individual to take a no-notice test while in
          their eligibility period, the individual must declare before taking the test whether
          they want the test to count as their closed book requisite examination. No-notice
          evaluations and tests that are credited toward a periodic evaluation will also count
          toward squadron no-notice goals. If the individual does not declare their intent to
          count the no-notice test toward the requisite closed book requirement before
          taking the test, or elects not to count the test, they will only get credit for the no-
          notice test and must still take the requisite closed book test before the end of their
          normal eligibility period.
          5.2.3.3.1.4. (Added-AMC) For mobility aircrews, as a minimum, all N/N
          evaluations will include items designated under ― General‖ as defined in the
          appropriate aircrew member’s chapter of the AFI 11-2MDS-Spe-cific Volume 2.
          Evaluate other areas, as appropriate.
          5.2.3.3.1.5. (Added-AMC) Evaluators will use items from the special interest
          program to target and assess specific areas during all N/N evaluations. Areas
          designated "special interest" are normally identified by higher headquarters
          message. OG and squadron may also designate areas. Squadron and OG will
          provide feedback on special interest areas through the SEB. Squadron, OG, and
          HQ AMC will develop a process to inform evaluators on the requirements of the
          special interest program.
          5.2.3.3.1.6. (Added-AMC) Detail the unit's N/N program (including N/N rate
          goal) in the unit supplement.
          5.2.3.3.1.6. (MACDILL) The 6/927 OG no-notice evaluation programs consist
          mainly of no-notice flights, but may include testing, flight manual publications
          checks, and supplemental evaluations of group/squadron training
          programs/classes. No-notice evaluations and/or testing apply to all crew positions
          and any crew member assigned to a squadron or attached for flying purposes.
          Crewmembers not eligible to receive a no-notice evaluation, in addition to those
          annotated in paragraph 5.2.3.3.1.2. (Added-AMC), are listed in Table 5.1
          (Added).

Senior staff: Wg/CC/CV, Gp/CC/CD, Director of Staff, IG, and the Wing Chief of Safety.
Sq/CCs, DOs, and OGV evaluators.
Crewmembers on supervised status or non-mission ready
Individuals within 2 months of completing a flight evaluation (date of flight)
Individuals within 2 months of a permanent change of station (PCS) into a squadron unless
approved by the OG/CC or SQ/CC.
Deployed crewmembers will not be given no-notice flights or examinations unless directed
by the deployed commander.

                  5.2.3.3.1.6.1. (Added-MACDILL) No-notice flight evaluations may be
                  conducted on any type of mission.
                  5.2.3.3.1.6.2. (Added-MACDILL) All no-notice flight evaluations will
                  include a closed book examination and Boldface (if applicable). The closed
                  book examination and Boldface (if applicable) must be completed within 5
                  working days of the flight activity. Crewmembers will not fly until all no-
                  notice requisites have been completed. Crewmembers may receive more than
                  one written no-notice test within a calendar year.
                  5.2.3.3.1.6.3. (Added-MACDILL) No-Notice             Cargo         Evaluation
                  Requirements. Cargo loading evaluations consist of cargo loading and/or
                  unloading and may occur on an operational mission or in a static environment.
                  5.2.3.3.1.6.4. (Added-MACDILL) OGV flight examiners may perform no-
                  notice flights, publications checks, or direct testing on any wing, group, or
                  squadron eligible aircrew member. OGV will notify the appropriate Sq/CC or
                  DO prior to performing a no-notice evaluation. Squadron evaluators may
                  perform no-notice flights, publications checks or direct testing on any of their
                  respective squadron assigned or attached crewmembers. They may conduct
                  no-notice evaluations outside of their squadron with the concurrence of the
                  respective Sq/CC or DO.
                  5.2.3.3.1.6.5. (Added-MACDILL) Crewmembers selected to take a no-
                  notice closed book test will be directed to do so in writing. Once directed to
                  take a no-notice test, completing the test takes precedence over all other
                  scheduled/ planned activities. Document the passing of a no-notice test by
                  stamping the back of the most current AF Form 8 with the date of the
                  examination, the score, and the name of the evaluator or SELO grading the
                  examination. Failure of a no-notice test will generate a COMMANDER
                  DIRECTED DOWNGRADE on an AF Form 8. The aircrew member will not
                  fly unsupervised until the corrective training, as directed by the commander, is
                  complete and a successful re-test is accomplished.
                  5.2.3.3.1.6.6. (Added-MACDILL) No-Notice Goal. OGV and/or Sq/DOVs
                  will collectively sample a minimum of 15 percent of each crew position for all
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              45


                 C-37, KC-135, and Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) qualified crewmembers in
                 the calendar year. Unit manning at the end of the previous calendar year will
                 be used to establish the following year’s goal. All assigned or attached
                 crewmembers, except AMC/A3V evaluators, Wg/CC/CV, OG/CC/CD,
                 Sq/CCs, and DOs, will count in determining the 15 percent goal. OGV will
                 track progress of this 15 percent annual goal using the following quarterly
                 goals: 1st quarter – 5 percent, 2nd quarter – 10 percent, 3rd quarter – 15
                 percent. The 4th quarter will be used to complete any remaining no-notice
                 evaluations required to meet the 15 percent goal. Navigators will not be
                 subject to these goals.
                 5.2.3.3.1.6.7. (Added-MACDILL) Sq/DOV will track and maintain a list of
                 current year no-notice goals/accomplishments in the squadron administration
                 program guide. OGV will track and maintain a list of current and previous
                 year no-notice goals/accomplishments and a record of any supplemental
                 evaluations conducted, in the OGV administration program guide.
         5.2.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. If all
         requirements were not completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized
         to complete required events. If the examinee elects not to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented
         as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
         5.2.3.3.2. (AMC) Before the start of a N/N evaluation and with the concurrence of
         the evaluator, the examinee may request that items accomplished during the
         evaluation be credited toward a periodic evaluation. Do not add on missions (flights)
         to complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/ squadron
         commander concurs with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation
         expiration date and approves the additional flight time requirements.
     5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
     in a simulator.
     5.2.3.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
     evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission Description
     in the Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraphs 7.3.7.3 and 7.4.7.3).
  5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew evaluations
  includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guidance on
  aircrew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination,
     Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
     5.2.4.1. (AMC) QUAL Evaluations. Publications Check. Each aircrew member, while
     performing aircrew duties, is responsible for assigned publications according to the
     appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3. For aircrew members participating in the
     Electronic Publications program, the publications review conducted as part of an
46                           AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        evaluation will include a check for currency. The evaluatee will demonstrate ability to
        navigate through and locate information in the electronic media. The evaluatee will
        demonstrate ability to locate information in paper publications required for in-flight use
        (i.e. checklists, publications kits, etc). If during the flight evaluation the publications are
        checked IAW AFI 11-215, this will suffice for the annual review. In this case the flight
        examiner will sign the AF IMT 1522.
        5.2.4.2. INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination.
        5.2.4.3. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
     in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
     performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and allow
     accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
     tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the
     unit mission.
     5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
        5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
        17th month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a
        periodic evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 04 expires on 31
        Mar 06.).
        5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (six-month
        period prior to expiration date).
        5.2.6.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by-
        case basis according to the following criteria:
            5.2.6.3.1. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders
            may extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to three months for the
            reasons listed below.
                5.2.6.3.1.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
                5.2.6.3.1.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft
                type.
                5.2.6.3.1.3. Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
                5.2.6.3.1.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or
                retirement from the Service).
                5.2.6.3.1.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include
                operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
                flight evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case
                basis and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
                deployments.
            5.2.6.3.2. For squadron commanders and above, the approval authority is the next
            commander in the member’s flying chain of command, with the concurrence of the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                             47


         member’s immediate supervisor, IAW the guidance provided in paragraph 5.2.6.3.1
         For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval authority.
         5.2.6.3.3. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize the
         extension of expiration dates of periodic aircrew qualification evaluations.
         5.2.6.3.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a memorandum for record
         (MFR) placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new
         expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension.
             5.2.6.3.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
             affected periodic evaluation.
             5.2.6.3.4.2. File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8/8a in Section II of the
             FEF.
             5.2.6.3.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
             completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
             5.2.6.3.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
             AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments,
             when action is complete and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record
             become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed
             by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Example: If an
             evaluation was extended based on an HHQ waiver, an MFR will remain in the
             FEF until such time as the next evaluation is completed. That waiver reference is
             commented on in para D of the Form 8/8a.
     5.2.6.4. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
     periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
     Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to a flying assignment in the same aircraft MDS, or
     during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY) (flying or non-flying), complete the
     required evaluation(s) before departing for either the PCS flying assignment or the TDY.
     Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval waiver for unusual situations.
  5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2. Requisites from a
  completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided they cover all
  required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. See also paragraph
  5.3.1. For aircrew possessing multiple instrument qualifications, the instrument exam may
  count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs for each evaluation IAW
  the provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1and 5.2.7.2 For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as
  follows:
     5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility
     period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that
     expiration date.
     5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
     period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
     month in which the flight evaluation was administered. EXCEPTION: For extended
48                          AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
        eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
        5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
            5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1 or
            5.2.7.2 remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.13.1
            5.2.7.3.2. Valid requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
            annotated on the recheck AF Form 8/8a. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include
            documentation of the flight phase evaluation, unless requisites were not completed or
            are required to complete the recheck. If the flight recheck is completed prior to
            completion of required requisites, delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until
            requisites are complete and enter the requisites on the recheck AF Form 8/8a.
            5.2.7.3.2. (AMC) In the event a recheck for a flight evaluation is completed prior to
            completion of all ground requisites, the individual must complete the requisites for
            the initial evaluation before the Re-Qual is administered.
     5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not
     possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight
     examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to
     this option. See the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, for areas prohibited from
     verbal/ATD evaluation.
     5.2.8. (AMC) Alternate Means of Evaluation. Do not verbally evaluate takeoffs,
     instrument approaches, landings, aerial refueling contacts, cargo loads or nursing care
     standards unless specified in the AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD
     10-9, in coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized
     INSTM, INSTR, MSN and QUAL evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
     Specific Volume 2. The lead command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
        5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those
        required and critical for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged
        into general and specific evaluation areas. Where required, mission areas/subareas will be
        further subdivided into general and specific mission areas.
        5.2.9.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Check. This is required for QUAL
        evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
            5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as
            outlined in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific series publications.
            5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current
            and properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
            members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
            required for the mission.
        5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the
        appropriate areas/subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
        Training Program, and MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              49


     5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
     and procedures. Must specifically ensure compliance with minimum safe maneuvering
     speeds below 10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission planning and
     flight operations.
  5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
  aircrew performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
  areas/subareas of aircrew performance are individually graded against established evaluation
  criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall
  qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
     5.2.10.1. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will establish
     areas and subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations - to
     include the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have
     a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be
     documented against the listed subareas.
         5.2.10.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
         satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within
         the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.10.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
         area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
         flight examiner. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
         prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
         5.2.10.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
         parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
         affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
         receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in
         the judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively
         improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner
         must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.2.10.2. Critical Area. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for the establishment of
     evaluation areas that, upon failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of an
     aircrew member. Critical areas include, but are not limited to, Airmanship, Flight
     Discipline and Safety. Grade all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Qualification Levels. EPEs and overall evaluation performance are graded by
     qualification levels as follows:
         5.2.10.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
         performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
         tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
         discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
             5.2.10.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
             area(s)/subarea(s).
             5.2.10.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies
             preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
50                          AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


               5.2.10.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during
               the debrief of that evaluation.
            5.2.10.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the
            ability to perform duties safely, but:
               5.2.10.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
               was assigned.
               5.2.10.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
               5.2.10.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
               performance in one or several areas/subareas.
            5.2.10.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
            unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
            5.2.10.3.3. (AMC) Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). Any requisite examination
            resulting in a failure to meet the minimum passing grade IAW para. 6.4.3.1. will
            result in an overall Q-3. After successful re-examination IAW para. 6.4.6., the overall
            qualification level will be annotated as ―3/1‖ in the qualified block on the AF FORM
            8 (and AF IMT 942, Record of Evaluation).
               5.2.10.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
               for the evaluation.
               5.2.10.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
               examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several
               areas/subareas.
        5.2.10.4. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q)
        or Unqualified (U).
        5.2.10.5. Written, Computer Based, or Electronic Examinations. Grade written,
        computer based, or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See
        paragraph 6.4.4.1 for minimum passing grade criteria.
     5.2.11. Grading Policies.
        5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on
        requisite examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-
        /U) grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the
        applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas.
            5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in
            the general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
            Volume 2.
            5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner will grade any area/subarea observed during an
            evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
            accomplished or flight safety.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                            51


         5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft
         conditions.
         5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
         acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
         deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
         determining the overall area/subarea grade.
         5.2.11.2.5. The flight examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as
         ―Commendable‖ if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has
         demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area.
         Document commendable areas in the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form
         8/8a.
     5.2.11.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
         5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
         performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-
         2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and
         given due consideration. An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.
         5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must
         satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and
         demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively
         during all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-2
         MDS Specific Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE
         based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the
         determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
     5.2.11.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation
     may be awarded by the flight examiner. The designation can only be applied to the total
     evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
         5.2.11.4.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
         all phases of the evaluation;
         5.2.11.4.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
         5.2.11.4.3. The aircrew member received a qualified grade with no remedial action
         on all areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.13 when discrepancies result in failure
  to pass a flight evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the
     discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
     proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is
52                          AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        annotated with ―
                       Debriefed‖ in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF
        Form 8/8a Comments.
        5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to
        remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
            5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a
            simulator or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
            attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
            5.2.12.2.1. (AMC) Initial qualification examinees will not fly as a qualified
            crewmember until additional training is complete.
            5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
            Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8/8a Comments
            section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
            knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or instructor.
            5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
            documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8/8a (see paragraphs 7.3.5.5
            and 7.4.5.5).
            5.2.12.2.4. The flight examiner or instructor who completed the additional training
            will sign as the Certifying Official under Additional Training, Section II, verifying
            completion of all assigned training as documented in paragraph C, Recommended
            Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks.
            5.2.12.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
            Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date
            of the discrepancy, e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 06, additional training must be
            accomplished by 30 Apr 06. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for
            completion of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation
            and direct appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in
            Section II of the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained
            in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D,
            Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFRs from the FEF.
            Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major
            discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
               5.2.12.2.5.1. (Added-AMC) Instructors, flight examiners, or authorized Aircrew
               Training System (ATS) contractor instructor personnel administer additional
               training.
               5.2.12.2.5.2. (Added-AMC) If additional training is not completed by due date,
               the aircrew member will fly in supervised status.
               5.2.12.2.5.3. (Added-AMC) An instructor or flight examiner graded Q-2 on any
               evaluation will not perform instructor or examiner duties until the Q-2 is cleared.
               Flight examiners will clear instructor Q-2s. Flight examiner Q-2s should be
               cleared according to the pyramid evaluation system.
     5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              53


     5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or
     ground recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first
     failure, e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 07, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 07. A
     recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or
     Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in
     this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in
     Section II of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
     action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
     permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
     addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Every reasonable effort must be made to
     requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed
     during this period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and
     hours of training required. The flight examiner that administered the original check will
     not normally administer the recheck.
     5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM,
     QUAL or MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-
     CMR), non-basic mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ)
     status, as applicable. For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC)
     need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
     5.2.13.2. (AMC) Status Downgrade. Mission evaluations graded overall Q-3 will
     result in non-mission ready status in that mission only.
         5.2.13.2.1. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Downgrade to lower crew duty position. In
         those cases where failure of a flight evaluation results in downgrading to a lower crew
         duty qualification (that is, instructor pilot to aircraft commander, aircraft commander
         to first pilot, etc.), these individuals may perform duty in the lower position without
         supervision provided that this action was recommended by the flight evaluator and
         properly annotated on the AF FORM 8.
  5.2.14. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.2.14.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.2.14.1.1. Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require restrictions to
         ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
         5.2.14.1.2. If defined in the MDS specific Volume 1 and/or Volume 2, formal
         schoolhouses will include restrictions on the AF Forms 8 for any core item not
         accomplished due to training limimitations, regardless if the method of qualification
         is by evaluation or instructor certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew
         perform core items in which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision
         of an instructor. In this case, MDS specific guidance will set the time requirement for
         completion of additional training.
54                       AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


     5.2.14.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item of the AF Form 8/8a Comments. Restrictions associated
     with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8/8a.
     5.2.14.3. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation until a successful evaluation
     is completed:
        5.2.14.3.1. For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in the
        aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
        evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For specialized
        qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining
        qualification for similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
        may direct supervised status in all aircraft in which the individual maintains
        qualification.
        5.2.14.3.1. (AMC) Qualification Evaluation. AECMs who Q-3 in one qualification
        aircraft will fly in supervised status in all aircraft until recheck in that aircraft is
        complete.
        5.2.14.3.2. For INSTM evaluations, restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
        examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
        5.2.14.3.3. MSN       Evaluation.    The      examinee      may      perform    basic
        qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
        supervised status for mission tasks.
        5.2.14.3.3. (AMC) Only applies to the specific Q-3 mission.
        5.2.14.3.4. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any
        instructor area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is
        completed.
        5.2.14.3.4. (AMC) Re-evaluation may be administered in the aircraft, verbally, or in
        an Aircrew Training Device (ATD) at the examiner's discretion.
        5.2.14.3.5. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Squadron commanders review the records
        of aircrew members who fail a flight evaluation. Document the commander’s review
        in the individual’s FEF. Squadron commander’s signature in Section III of the AF
        FORM 8 satisfies this requirement.
            5.2.14.3.5.1. (Added-AMC) AGR, ART, and Traditional Reservist (TR) aircrew
            members are disqualified or removed from aviation service when they indicate a
            repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance according to AFI 11-
            402, as supplemented, and reassigned to a non-flying position or removed under
            the provisions of AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.
            5.2.14.3.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian aircrew members are notified according to
            AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program, when they fail to pass
            a qualification examination or flight evaluation. They may be removed from
            aviation service and reassigned to a non-flying position, or removed under the
            provisions of AFI 36-704 when they indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or
            marginal performance.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              55


  5.2.15. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the aircrew
  member be placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated
  supervisor) will be determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified
  in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or
  designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1) qualified in the
  specific aircrew position.
  5.2.16. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in
  paragraph 5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses
  the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.14.3 apply.
  Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see
  paragraph 5.2.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs may approve
  waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
  evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II
  of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form
  8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete,
  and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF
  only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a
  later Form 8/8a.
  5.2.17. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members
  who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft. When differences
  between series aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead MAJCOM, in
  coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate qualification
  requirements. When separate qualification is not required, document certification in different
  MDS series using AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form
  4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification
  document signed by an authorized official (such as a Letter of X’s).
  5.2.17. (AMC) Multiple Qualification. Unit certification document is the Letter of X’s.
  This replaces the use of 1381/4348s. The Letter of X’s is populated by signed AF IMT
  4324s. See Attachment 10 for sample letter of X’s. The unit training officer, in coordination
  with the SARM, will generate a monthly Letter of X’s to be signed by the SQ/CC or
  authorized official. SQ/DOV will maintain monthly letters for 12 Months. Flight Evaluators
  may make pen and ink changes to the latest/master letter to update certifications until the
  next monthly letter is published. Changes must be initialed by the evaluator. Evaluators will
  not annotate own certifications. A copy of the latest Letter of X’s will be placed in the
  member’s FEF prior to PCS for record.
  5.2.17. (MACDILL) Multiple Qualification. The Letter of X’s will be maintained by
  each Sq/DOV. At the beginning of each month, a new Letter of X’s will be produced for the
  Sq/CC to sign. The original signed letter will be kept in a common location for reference in
  the squadron. All other copies, other than the original, will be annotated with ―//SIGNED//‖
  versus a photocopy of the signed version. A copy should be forwarded to OG/OGV.
  Additionally, a current copy will be placed in the mobility folder of all deploying personnel
  (N/A 45 AES). Sq/CCs and flight examiners may make pen & ink changes to the
  latest/master Letter of X’s. All changes must be initialed.

        5.2.17.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
        including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in an MFR placed in
        Section II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority
        may be delegated, but not lower than wing commander.) See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for
        additional guidance.
        5.2.17.1. (AMC) For O-6 and below, HQ AMC/A3 is approval authority according to
        AFI 11-202 Volume 1. Forward request through channels (Sq/CC, OG/CC, AMC/A3V,
        etc.). For AFRC, HQ AFRC/DO is approval authority. Refer to AFI 11-202 Vol 1, AFRC
        Sup 1 for procedures to request multiple qualifications. For ANG, approval authority is
        NGB/A3O. Multiple qualifications of General Officers is IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
        AMC/A3V AF Flight Nurse (FN) and Aeromedical Evacuation Technician (AET)
        examiners may maintain multiple qualifications in the C-17, C-130, KC-135 and C-21
        when applicable.
            5.2.17.1.1. (Added-AMC) Approved          crewmembers       completing     multiple
            qualifications see the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1 for training
            requirements. Complete certification or evaluation according to the appropriate AFI
            11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
        5.2.17.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
        include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified
        by the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are
        directed by the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
        5.2.17.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL
        evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission
        design series aircraft according to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. When
        specified IAW paragraph 5.2.17, QUAL and MSN evaluations are required for different
        series aircraft in the same MDS.
        5.2.17.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results
        in a downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A
        downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft
        for which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the
        discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft.
     5.2.18. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized
     aircrew who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft where
     qualification is attained/maintained via a minimum of a ground phase examination.
     MAJCOMs may require a flight phase evaluation. AE crewmembers require a ground and
     flight phase evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2AE, Volume 2. The flight phase evaluation, when
     required, may be accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either
     gaining or maintaining qualification, and will update qualification on all aircraft listed on the
     specialized aircrew member’s Aeronautical Order (AO). MAJCOMs may specify additional
     ground phase requisites.
        5.2.18.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualification
        IAW Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified
        crewmember eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              57


      5.2.18.2. Documentation. Specialized aircrew qualifications maintained under
      Universal qualification guidance will be documented on an AF Form 8a, IAW
      paragraph 7.4 AECM qualification will be documented using AF Form 8, IAW
      paragraph 7.3 Flight surgeon qualification may be documented using either AF Form 8
      or AF Form 8a, IAW paragraph 8.2.8 or paragraph 8.2.9.
      5.2.18.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications
      maintained under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A
      MSN evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
      and/or MAJCOM supplement to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will
      include a flight phase evaluation in one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member
      maintains qualification.
      5.2.18.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally
      qualified aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in
      loss of applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI 11-2 MDS-
      Specific Volumes 2.
   5.2.19. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
   Units. Aircrew members authorized to perform duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
   AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host
   service or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a current physical
   and review their flight records according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily
   abide by USAF guidance, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
   Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must complete applicable
   requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during their tour.
   The restrictions in paragraph 5.2.14 of this instruction apply to such individuals until
   successful evaluations are completed.
      1.MAJCOMs may approve exceptions to requirements for returning aircrew members to
         complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case
         review, they determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2
         MDS-Specific Volume 2 evaluations. Document such action with an MFR placed in
         Section II of the FEF on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8 equivalent.
      2.Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying
         program will comply with current Air Force guidance, unless excepted by proper
         authority. See AFI 11-401 for definitions of Air Force and US Government aircraft.
5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations.
   5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs and systems
   knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and
   systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for
   each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN
   evaluation). A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
   INSTM/QUAL eval). The combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required
   areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.

     5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the
     proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is
     responsible for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
     5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will specify
     contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading criteria and whether EPEs may be
     done inflight, in an ATD, or verbally.
     5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade 1, 2, or 3 (Qualification
     Level 1, 2, or 3) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8a, regardless of
     whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed inflight.
     5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner
     will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before next flight under
     restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 8/8a.
     5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
     an EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a 3 grade as
     a result of Boldface/CAPs error will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
     accomplished.
     5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (3) will be
     placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These
evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists)
where results are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander.
5.4. (MACDILL) Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations will                      be
documented using the attached Supplementary Evaluation Sheets, Attachment 14 (Added).
     5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
     5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the
     method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection, and
     will report results as directed by the commander.
        5.4.2.1. (Added-MACDILL) Ground Supplementary Evaluations. The purpose of the
        ground portion of the supplementary evaluation program is to provide information on
        base-wide training programs so the effectiveness of operational procedures, training
        programs, and unit readiness can be better assessed. All flight examiners should evaluate
        continuation training courses as part of their continuation training requirements.
     5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct
     supplementary evaluations.
     5.4.3. (MACDILL) Instructors are encouraged to identify possible trend issues to Sq/DOV
     and/or OGV for supplementary evaluation consideration.
     5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
     evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all-
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                             59


  encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific aircrew
  member, nor be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
     5.4.4.1. (Added-MACDILL) In-flight Supplementary Evaluations. The purpose of the
     flight evaluation portion of the supplementary evaluation program is to provide additional
     data to that collected from flight evaluations. This provides commanders with greater
     ability to assess the effectiveness of operational procedures, training programs, and unit
     readiness. The need for supplementary evaluations may be indicated by adverse trends
     identified in quarterly analysis. In-flight supplementary evaluations normally cover a
     specific topic for a finite period. Examples of in-flight supplementary evaluations are
     tactics, formation, or evaluation trends. If an evaluation is warranted or directed, OGV
     will initiate the study, outline the duration of observations, designate flight examiners,
     and consolidate findings. The outcome of the supplementary evaluation will be reported
     to the commander.
  5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.
     5.4.5.1. (Added-MACDILL) Supplementary Evaluation results and suggested
     improvements will be summarized for inclusion at the SEB. Corrective actions, if
     warranted, will be decided by the OG/CC during the SEB.

                          AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer-based
or electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, navigators, and air battle managers), career
enlisted aviator (CEA), and non-rated X-prefix AE aircrew. For Flight Surgeons (rated) and non-
rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code), see Chapter 8. The
examination program in this chapter includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and
unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open book and closed
book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in
paragraph 5.2.4. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
     6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination program
     in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
     information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
     this instruction.
     6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam
     answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
     6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs, secure
     question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
     documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may
     be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing and
     updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this instruction.
     6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses
     listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
     (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the
     requirements of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite
     examinations.
        6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate
        with the MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of
        this instruction and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 before awarding credit for
        requisite completion.
        6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs.
        All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures
        and not conflict with any MQFs.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              61


      6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will
      be graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1 and entered on the AF Form 8 according to
      paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and
Boldface/CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.1), instrument examination as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.2), and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
Specific Volume 2 (see paragraph 5.2.4.3).
6.4. (AMC) Requisite Examinations. Unless otherwise specified in the appropriate AFI 11-
2MDS-Specific Volume 2, individuals qualified as crewmembers in more than one MDS aircraft
must complete open and closed book exam for each aircraft.
   6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs
   examinations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position or generate a
   unique test for each aircrew member requiring an exam.
   6.4.1. (MACDILL) Requisite Examination Management. OGV is responsible for
   writing and updating all open book Secure Question Banks (SQB). OGV will review all
   SQBs at least annually and following any changes to source documents. SQBs will be
   updated, as necessary, to keep them current. Sq/DOVs will build, maintain, and administer
   requisite open/closed book exams for each crew position and instrument exams for
   pilots/navigators. Sq/DOVs will use the master question file (MQF) provided by AMC/A3V
   for building closed book exams, the SQBs provided by OGV for generating open book
   exams, and the Air Force Flight Standardization Agency (AFFSA) Instrument Examination
   test bank for generating instrument exams. Tests will be administered electronically via PEX
   in a designated testing area. A test room monitor (assigned evaluators or SELO) will monitor
   the test room while tests are being administered. Test monitors will administer and grade
   tests, handle test question issues, and ensure effective security to prevent compromise of
   testing materials.
      6.4.1.1. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position:
          6.4.1.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two requisite
          examinations for each crew position.
          6.4.1.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one
          examination.
          6.4.1.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information,
          units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
          6.4.1.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on requisite
          examinations each calendar year.
      6.4.1.2. If a unique test is generated for each aircrew member requiring an exam:
          6.4.1.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation.
          6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
          ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
          generated.
62                          AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


     6.4.2. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
     requisite exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
     EXCEPTION: Requisite Open-book Flight Surgeon examination will be maintained by
     AFMOA/SG3P.
     6.4.3. Grading Policy For Examinations.
        6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs
        exams is 100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite
        examinations is 85 percent - corrected to 100 percent.
        6.4.3.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will
        grade all completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew member’s
        next flight. In the unit supplement to this instruction describe how this restriction is
        enforced.
            6.4.3.2.1. (Added-MACDILL) All tests will be graded and debriefed immediately
            after they are completed. For Boldface or test failures, the test monitor will notify the
            Sq/CC or DO, Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM), and scheduling to
            ensure the individual does not fly (Boldface failure) or fly unsupervised (testing
            failure) until a successful retake has been accomplished.
            6.4.3.2.2. (Added-MACDILL) Exam Review and Update Procedures. Sq/DOV
            personnel have the authority to grant credit for disputed test questions. Sq/DOVs will
            document and email information on disputed questions to OGV for corrective action
            as required. OGV will notify the respective agency with errors to the IRC MQF or
            the KC-135/C-37 Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM) MQF.
     6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
        6.4.4.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from
        publications containing information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and
        performance of the assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications
        used to generate the exam will be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an
        open book secure question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the
        open book examination questions. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
        safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval examination. Electronic
        publications may be used for open book examinations.
            6.4.4.1.1. (Added-AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific
            Volume 2, Open book exam will be derived from the Secure Question Bank (SQB)
            for each crew position of each MDS. The OG/OGV will create and manage the Open
            book examination process. Open book questions will be drawn from appropriate
            information contained in FCIF Volumes I, II, III, and IV.
            6.4.4.1.1. (MACDILL) Open Book Exam. The C-37A open book test will consist
            of 60-100 questions. A portion of the open book examination administered to flight
            instructors will include instructor (scenario-based) questions. The KC-135 open book
            examination will be generated in accordance with AFI 11-2KC-135V2, Aircrew
            Evaluation Criteria. The AECM open book examination will be generated in
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                           63


        accordance with AFI 11-2AEV2, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Evaluation
        Criteria.
           6.4.4.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Crewmembers qualified to conduct ground taxi
           operations will be tested on their knowledge of marshaling signals IAW AFI 11-
           218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. Units may administer a
           ground marshaling examination as part of the open book examination.
           6.4.4.1.1.1. (MACDILL) Ground Marshalling Exam. Sq/DOTs and/or OST will
           ensure compliance with AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
           Ground, and AFI 11-218_AMCSUP, paragraph 1.13. Sq/DOVs will administer
           the ground marshalling examination via PEX. Sq/DOVs should include a random
           sampling of ground marshalling questions in open book tests of crewmembers
           qualified to conduct ground taxi operations.
        6.4.4.1.2. (Added-AMC) A portion of each open book exam will include questions
        pertaining to each mission qualification of the individual being tested. Include
        airdrop, AR, SOLL II, PNAF, cargo, instructor (scenario type), etc., as required.

        in accordance with AFI11-2AEV2.
     6.4.4.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs.
     These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe
     flight and mission accomplishment.
        6.4.4.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-
        Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are available
        for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable aircrew.
        6.4.4.2.1. (AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume
        2, mobility forces complete their closed book examination using a minimum of 20
        questions from the MQF. When developing a closed book examination from the
        MQF, the unit should select questions to sample aircrew knowledge areas or correct
        potential trends.
           6.4.4.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may
           develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without MAJCOM
           expertise. That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM for
           approval prior to their publication.
           6.4.4.2.1.1. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will coordinate, build, maintain and
           distribute one common MQF for each crew position of each MDS. The MQF will
           contain at least 100 questions with periodic updates, as necessary. A
           comprehensive MQF is encouraged. MQF questions will be derived from the
           basic aircraft flight manual, performance manual, other applicable technical
           orders, AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3, AFTTP 3-1.1, AFTTP 3-1.2 and
           AFTTP 3-1/3 MDS Specific. AMC/A3V may delegate a portion or all of MQF

            development and maintenance requirements to specific active duty, ANG, or
            AFRC units; or a designated civilian contractor providing this service, but will
            maintain active supervision of MQF contents.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes
            to MQFs as necessary.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. (AMC) MQFs are available for download on the AMC/A3V
            website. The OG will distribute the MQF to all unit aircrew members.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
                administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
                procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.1. (AMC) OGV will forward corrections to AMC/A3V.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate
                MAJCOM.
        6.4.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local
        procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs.
        6.4.4.2.2. (AMC) May be included in the SQB.
     6.4.4.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the
     Instrument MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The
     selection and content of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
     6.4.4.3. (AMC) Instrument Requisite Exams. Exam requirements follow open book
     format and the exam is normally generated at the unit level. IRC program and Instrument
     Examination questions are available on Air Force Flight Standardization Agency
     (AFFSA)                     website,                       IRC                     Page:
     ttps://wwwmil.andrews.af.mil/pages/AFFSA/xo/xof/xof_dir.htm.
        6.4.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) instrument
        examinations remain valid concurrent with the individual's initial qualification
        instrument evaluation. IRC or equivalent courseware may satisfy this requirement.
        Units will determine an internal process for managing ENJJPT instrument
        examination dates and scores. Incorporate the scores on the individual’s first initial
        qualification AF Form 8.
     6.4.4.4. (Added-AMC) Tactics Requisite Exams.              All pilots, navigators, flight
     engineers and loadmasters will accomplish a Tactics Examination as a requisite to their
     recurring mission evaluation. Boom operators will accomplish the tactics exam as a
     requisite to their air refueling qual (KC-10) and qual/msn (KC-135) flight evaluation, and
     not in association with their qual/msn (KC-10) and msn (KC-135) cargo evaluation.
     Communications System Operators (CSO) Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
     (AECM) and Flight Attendants (FA) are not required to take the Tactics exam. The
     tactics exam will consist of a minimum of 25 questions from the Secure Question Bank
     (SQB). Tactics exams are not crewmember specific. Only two test versions are required
     IAW para 6.4.1.1.1. Include tactics exam scores on the AF FORM 8 .
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              65


        6.4.4.4.1. (Added-AMC) AMC Tactics has created a classified secure question bank
        (SQB) for each MDS which may be obtained by contacting AMC/A3D at DSN: 779-
        1765. AMC/A3D will continue to maintain the AMC tactics SQB. Instructions for
        obtaining         the           SQB           are         on          SIPRNET
        at:http://www.amc.scott.af.smil.mil/hosted_orgs/dok/A39T/G060/G060.htm
        6.4.4.4.2. (Added-AMC) OG/CCs will determine the best way to facilitate the
        Tactics exam based on group manning and logistics/secure areas. OG/CCs are
        encouraged to use the resources at their disposal to provide suitable classified testing
        and study areas. The long term goal is for units to acquire appropriate AMCI11-207
        compliant facilities and for Stan/Eval to begin producing and administering the tactics
        exam. Access to electronic publications is preferred where practical.
        6.4.4.4.2. (MACDILL) Crewmembers will report to OST for administration of the
        Tactics examination in a secure environment. Sq/DOVs will coordinate with OST to
        obtain individual test scores in a timely manner and track questions missed for trend
        purposes.
  6.4.5. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.5.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated
     through a written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
     6.4.5.1. (AMC) Examinations will consist of one question concerning each Bold
     Face/Critical Action Emergency Procedure applicable to an individual's specialty.
     Individuals qualified as crew members in more than one MDS aircraft must complete a
     Bold Face exam for each aircraft.
     6.4.5.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing
     the proper actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight
     examiner will assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase
     block of the AF Form 8/8a.
     6.4.5.2. (AMC) AMC policy is that Bold Face will be written as depicted in the flight
     manual (dash 1 or Vol 3 for AECM) aircrew checklists, to include the correct crew
     positions for the prescribed action. Unit commanders will ensure that crews are trained to
     this standard; however, HQ AMC does not intend for examiners to quibble over
     punctuation or minor misspellings. AFRC units will accomplish a Boldface Exam prior
     to the first flight of each month.
     6.4.5.3. (Added-MACDILL) All KC-135/AE crewmembers will complete a Boldface
     examination in conjunction with all closed book examinations.
  6.4.6. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all
  failed items have been successfully re-accomplished.
     6.4.6.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination at
     any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other
     than Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
     6.4.6.1. (AMC) Reexamination Policy. An initial qualification or requalification
     student who fails an Aircrew Training System (ATS) examination while attending
66                       AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


     FTU/CCTS training will retake the ATS exam and complete the appropriate open and
     closed book examinations before flight evaluations.
     6.4.6.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination
     must complete a successful reexamination by the end of the third month following the
     date of the first failure, or the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first.
     Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is
     the OG/CC. Document such waivers with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF of the
     affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
     action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
     permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
     addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
     6.4.6.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
     Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is
     accomplished.
     6.4.6.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite
     open book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful
     retesting is completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications,
     supervised status resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination
     applies only to the aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of a
     requisite instrument exam results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all
     aircraft in which instrument qualification is required.
     6.4.6.5. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Squadron commanders review flying records of
     aircrew members who fail to take or pass a written standardization examination.
     Document this review describing the circumstances/ actions to be taken and keep on file
     in the unit standardization/training section until corrective action is completed. R&C
     Board action will fulfill this requirement.
        6.4.6.5.1. (Added-AMC) AGR, ART, and Traditional Reservist aircrew members
        are:
            6.4.6.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Notified in writing of unsatisfactory performance
            when they fail to pass a written examination. Notification includes the training
            program to be pursued to restore the individual’s qualification.
            6.4.6.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Disqualified or removed from aviation service when
            they indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance according
            to AFI 11-402, as supplemented, and reassigned to a non-flying position or
            removed under the provisions of AFI 36-704.
        6.4.6.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian aircrew members are:
            6.4.6.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Notified according to AFI 36-1001 when they fail to
            pass a qualification examination or flight evaluation.
            6.4.6.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) Removed from aviation service and reassigned to a
            non-flying position, or removed under the provisions of AFI 36-704 when they
            indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance.

6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a
requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. Units will
describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed
exams.
6.5. (AMC) Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Ground N/N Exam. Unit's Periodic
Examination program may be combined with unit N/N program. Include program details in unit
supplement.
6.5. (MACDILL) Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). 6/927 OG does not utilize the
optional periodic examination program.
   6.5.1. (Added-AMC) An AF Form 8 will not be generated simply for a failed periodic
   examination.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which an aircrew member is to be
evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of aircrew evaluations
are recorded on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a, which certifies the qualification of the aircrew
member. The chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF
Form 942, Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the aircrew
member. EXCEPTION: Not required for cadets participating in USAFA airmanship programs.
     7.1.1. (Added-MACDILL) Sq/DOV and/or OGV will ensure that all flight examiners are
     trained on AF Form 8 and AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet, procedures.
     Evaluators will use the evaluator checklist provided by Sq/DOVs to ensure all required
     actions are accomplished.
     7.1.2. (Added-MACDILL) The 6 OG will utilize the following processes to ensure timely
     and accurate completion of all AF Forms 8.
        7.1.2.1. (Added-MACDILL) Immediately following the completion of an evaluation, at
        a minimum, the evaluator will complete the squadron evaluation log and file a signed
        copy of the AF Form 3862 with an overall qualification level indicated in the examinee’s
        FEF. If a qualification level 2 or 3 is given, or the evaluation debrief cannot be
        immediately accomplished for an evaluation that may result in a qualification level 2 or
        3, the evaluator will immediately notify the Sq/CC and/or DO, Sq/DOV, Scheduling, and
        SARMS, so that the status (qualified or supervised) of the individual is clearly
        understood. Sq/DOV should notify OGV at the earliest opportunity whenever a
        qualification level 2 or 3 is given.
        7.1.2.2. (Added-MACDILL) Within 1 duty day after the completion of post-mission
        crew rest (if applicable), the evaluator should complete the actions required by the
        evaluator checklist. Actions consist of completing the AF Form 8. (AF Form 3862 is an
        in-flight worksheet and need not be ― completed‖ as long as the AF Form 8 is completed
        by the evaluator.) The completed AF Form 8 will be reviewed by at least one additional
        Stan/Eval representative. Two copies of the AF Form 8 will be printed and signed. One
        copy of the signed AF Form 8 will be annotated as a draft and will be placed in the
        examinee’s FEF and the other copy will be routed for signatures. SELOs may assist
        flight examiners in completing paperwork, but should not complete the draft AF Form 8.
        The SELO may assist the flight examiner by ensuring that the steps in the evaluation
        checklist are completed.
        7.1.2.3. (Added-MACDILL) Once the AF Form 8 is completed, the AF Form 3862
        should be destroyed. Signatures for the AF Form 8 should be obtained as soon as
        possible. Sq/DOVs will establish a process to ensure the AF Form 8 and all associated
        processing steps in the evaluation checklist are completed in a timely manner.
        7.1.2.4. (Added-MACDILL) OGV will review any AF Form 8 graded less than Q-1.
        Additionally, OGV will monitor the AF Form 8 and FEF process by spot-checking
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                              69


       random FEFs during program reviews. At the unit’s request, OGV will review any AF
       Form 8.
   7.1.3. (Added-MACDILL) The 927 OG will utilize the following processes to ensure
   timely and accurate completion of all AF Forms 8.
       7.1.3.1. (Added-MACDILL) At the conclusion of the flight phase of the evaluation, the
       evaluator will complete the actions required by the evaluator checklist. Actions consist
       of completing and signing the 927 OG/OGV Form 3862P/AF Form 4031, CRM Skills
       Criteria Training/Evaluation, notifying OGV whenever qualification level 2 or 3
       performances are observed, and submitting the 927 OG/OGV Form 3862P/AF Form
       4031 to OGV. The OGV secretary will transcribe data into PEX and place the signed
       927 OG/OGV Form 3862P/AF Form 4031 into the examinee’s FEF to serve as a draft AF
       Form 8. Upon completion, the OGV secretary will route the AF Form 8 to the Flight
       Examiner, Reviewing Officer, Final Approving Officer, and Examinee. Once the AF
       Form 8 is completed and signed, the 927 OG/OGV Form 3862P/AF Form 4031 will be
       removed from the examinee’s FEF and replaced with the AF Form 8.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Aircrew qualifications are attained through evaluations
and documented on the AF Form 8 or the AF Form 8a, as applicable. Aircrew certifications
attained through methods other than evaluation (instructor-certified events and commander
certifications for example) may be documented on an AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air
Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. As an alternative to use of AF
Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document
signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification. Certification of an AF
   Form 8 is accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who
   completes the evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final
   Approving Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all
   required additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete,
   and sign the AF Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8. EXCEPTION: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8,
   only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.4.8.
   7.3.1. (MACDILL) Purpose. An AF Form 8 is always required for flight evaluations.
   Unless the evaluation is a cargo check, it will not count as a completed evaluation if the
   sortie does not get airborne (i.e., a no-notice is started but, during ground operations, the
   sortie is canceled) unless the reason for not getting airborne is due to the examinee’s
   substandard performance.
       7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see
       paragraph 7.3.9).
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8.
   See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.

     7.3.2. (MACDILL) General Data Entry. Standardization among the flying units is
     essential. To facilitate accurate and complete AF Forms 8, it is the responsibility of
     evaluators/SELOs to ensure the AF Form 8 is standardized according to Chapter 7 of AFI 11-
     202V2 and AFI 11-202V2_AMCSUP. All evaluators must be proficient in preparing an AF
     Form 8.
        7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-
        digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.
        7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter
        month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by
        the form.
        7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph
        7.3.7, sample AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the
        data presented (see Attachment 3).
        7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
        otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.
        7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
        (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
        specific format standards for such data entry.
     7.3.3. Date Completed.
        7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date (ground or flight phase) of the evaluation
        requisites or the additional training.
        7.3.3.2. Use this date on the AF Form 942.
     7.3.4. Section I - Examinee Identification.

         but not intended to satisfy a recurring requirement (e.g. SPOT, N/N SPOT, etc.)
         7.3.4.4.3. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 06 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 07, enter
         ―INSTM: Jun-Nov 06/QUAL: Aug 06-Jan 07‖ for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
         7.3.4.4.4. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.2.6.3.1, enter
         the 6-month period preceding the original expiration date. Note: Squadron
         commanders extend only the expiration date, not the eligibility period.
  7.3.5. Section II - Qualification.
     7.3.5.1. Ground Phase.

        for the aircrew member’s overall qualification level.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (i.e., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN) require
        only one qualification level number if all parts of the evaluation were awarded the
        same qualification level grade.
        7.3.5.3.3. If the qualification levels assigned parts of a combined evaluation vary,
        indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., ― INSTM: 1‖ and
        ―QUAL: 2‖ in the qualified block or ―    INSTM/MSN: 1‖ in the qualified block and
        ―QUAL: 3‖ in the unqualified block).

7.6. AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training. Optional. If used, comply
with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 1381. MAJCOMs may prescribe use
of AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348 (see paragraph 7.7). If prescribed, use either form. See
Attachment 6 for sample AF Form 1381.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 1381 provides a permanent record/certification source for
   aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification. (MAJCOMs may
   approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized official. An authorized
   official for a unit certification document will be an official authorized to approve an AF
   Form 8 or 8a, or another appropriate authority designated in writing by this official.)
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 1381 in the FEF, Section I, documenting
      certifications by individual assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew members
      with multiple aircraft certifications attained through difference training, only one AF
      Form 1381 is required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms
      1381 in chronological order with the most recent on top. Note: May also be filed in an
      aircrew member’s permanent training folder, as a training completion document. When
      AF Form 1381 is used as a training completion document, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume
      1, for guidance.
      7.6.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
          7.6.1.2.1. The AF Form 1381 will document all certifications attained in previous
          and current MDS(s). Retain as a historical source document. File AF Forms 1381 in
          chronological order with the most recent on top.
          7.6.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review AF Form 1381
          entries in the aircrew member’s training folder to determine applicable certifications
          of new assigned/attached aircrew members. Document aircrew certifications as
          specified by the assigned/attached flying unit commander on a new AF Form 1381.
              7.6.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the squadron
              commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries signifying acceptance
              of those events listed above (see paragraph 7.6.7 for documentation
              requirements).
          7.6.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form 1381
          certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.6.3.4.
      7.6.1.3. Do not use AF Form 1381 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
      directed by HHQ.
      7.6.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 1381
      entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
      Volume 1; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 3, MDS XX - Operations Procedures;
      CONOPS; HHQ messages; and local unit guidance.
      7.6.1.5. MAJCOMs supplements may specify procedures or sources for preparing AF
      Forms 1381.
   7.6.2. General Data Entry.

        initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II) and last four of SSAN.
        7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification or decertification.
        7.6.2.3. Enter each certification or decertification in chronological order base on the date
        the action is completed.
        7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 1381, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
        two-digit year format (e.g., 20 Dec 05), or as required by electronic form (20051220).
     7.6.3. Certification.

        7.6.3.2. Subject Title. Enter each certification title on the AF Form 1381.
        7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
            7.6.3.3.1. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of
            the applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU
            if no AF Form 8/8a is issued.
        7.6.3.4. Certification Official/Organization. The Certifying Official will sign above their
        typed name, rank, organization and office symbol.
        7.6.3.5. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
        approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
        7.6.3.6. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
        1381. Use additional lines on the AF Form 1381, as necessary.
     7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
     Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
        7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
            7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
            but also apples to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
            substandard performance).
            7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, line out the event, date and
            certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Decertification for Cause‖ under
            Training Requirement/Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
            Completed; enter name, rank, organization, and office symbol and signature of
            decertifying official under Certifying Official/Organization.
        7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
        performance.
            7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
            occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1, when
            instructor certified events become core mission events, or when a higher certification
            is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
            applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
            substandard performance.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                               95


          7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification: line out the event, date and
          certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―   Discretionary Decertification‖
          under Training Requirement/Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
          Completed; enter name, rank, organization and office symbol of the decertifying
          official under Certifying Official/Organization. Note: For decertification due to loss
          of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
          decertification will be the date of certification loss.
          7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
          Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: line out the event, date and
          certifying official/organization/location; annotate ― Renamed (new name)‖ under
          Subject Title.
          7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
          stan/eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 1381 indicating the new MDS and
          transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.2.2.
   7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
   information for an AF Form 1381 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
   AF Form 1381.
   7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 1381. Units may use a computer-generated AF
   Form 1381 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
   maintained. Computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the Air Force
   e-Publishing web site.
      7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 1381 must be signed IAW paragraph
      7.6.1.2.2.1.
      7.6.6.2. The last signature on a computer-generated AF Form 1381 certifies:
          7.6.6.2.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.6.6.2.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-

   been authorized by the squadron commander to sign the last line of an AF Form 1381.
7.7. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. Optional. Use in place of AF Form 1831
when used. If used, comply with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 4348. See
Attachment 7 for sample AF Forms 4348.
   7.7.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a permanent record and certification source for
   aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification.
      7.7.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
96                           AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


        members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
        qualification in each aircraft (i.e. F-16C and F-16CG), only one AF Form 4348 is
        required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms 4348 in
        chronological order with the most recent on top.
        7.7.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
        aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
        certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
            7.7.1.2.1. The AF Form 4348 will document all certifications attained in previous
            and current MDS(s). Retain in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1, as a historical source
            document. File AF Forms 4348 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
            7.7.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form
            4348 entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached
            aircrew member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the
            gaining flying unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
                7.7.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the squadron
                commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above
                certification transcriptions are accurate (see paragraph 7.7.7 for documentation
                requirements).
            7.7.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form 4348
            certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.7.3.4.
        7.7.1.3. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
        directed by HHQ.
        7.7.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
        entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS Specific,
        Volume 1; AFI 11-2 MDS Specific, Volume 3; CONOPS; HHQ messages; and local unit

     7.7.3.6. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.7.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.7.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.7.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also apples to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.7.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an ―    X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.7.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.7.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1, when
         instructor certified events become core mission events, or when a higher certification
         is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
         applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
         substandard performance.
         7.7.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―      X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For
         decertification due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the
         effective date of decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.7.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―  Renamed (new
         title)‖ under Remarks.

            7.7.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
            stan/eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
            transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.7.1.2.2.
     7.7.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
     information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
     AF Form 4348.
     7.7.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
     Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
     maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
     e-Publishing web site.
        7.7.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW paragraphs
        7.7.1.2.2.1, 7.7.3.4, 7.7.4.1, and 7.7.4.2 as applicable.
        7.7.6.2. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
            7.7.6.2.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
            certifying official.
            7.7.6.2.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
            proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
            generated AF Form 4348.
     7.7.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
     certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
     certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
     are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/DOV has
     been authorized by the squadron commander to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
     signify transcription accuracy IAW paragraph 7.7.1.2.2.1.
7.8. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8/8a accomplished by the aircrew member.
     7.8.1. Data Entry. The sample AF Form 942 is provided to demonstrate the content, not the
     format, of the data presented (see Attachment 5).
        7.8.1.1. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except type of evaluation designations
        in capital letters, use upper and lower case letters.
        7.8.1.2. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
        (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
        specific format standards for such data entry.
        7.8.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those on which
        the qualification levels awarded portions of a combined evaluation are not all the same.
        7.8.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
        any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
        awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
        level.
        7.8.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is filled or ―
                                                            Z‖ out any unused blocks.

   made for each change in the MAJCOM under which an evaluation was administered.
   7.8.6. (AMC) MAJCOM Change. This includes temporary duty in AETC to attend formal
   training courses.
   7.8.7. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
   used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Computer-generated forms must mirror AF
   forms as published on the Air Force e-Publishing web site. Electronic copies of the AF Form
   942 should be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron. If
   electronic backups are normally maintained on removable storage media (e.g., DVD-
   ROM/CD-ROM, external hard drive, floppy disk) or are specifically prepared to facilitate
   transfer of an FEF, file the storage media in Section I of the FEF.
7.9. Flight Evaluation Folders The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the
history of flying qualification for each aircrew member. The AF Form 8/8a is the source
document used to record and certify the qualification of an aircrew member. A complete history
of the AF Forms 8/8a in an FEF is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 942.
   7.9.1. Maintenance. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF, which
   includes all AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381/4348 (optional; see paragraphs

         7.9.1.3. The FEF for personnel in inactive flying status will be maintained with their
         Flight Records Folder (FRF).
         7.9.1.4. FEF maintenance may be further defined in the MAJCOM supplement to this
         instruction.
         7.9.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
         the service of the unit of attachment to document their history of
         qualification/certification.
      7.9.2. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections:
         7.9.2.1. Section I (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms
         1381/4348 (if used); see paragraph 7.2 for use of alternate documentation, MAJCOM
         required items and those items authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g.,
         logs of initial and annual reviews). Section I may contain two tabbed sub-sections, Tabs
         are optional.
             7.9.2.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top of Tab 1 this section (when tabs are
             used), in chronological order with the most recent on top. Place the AF Form
             1381/4348, if used (or alternate document) or any certifications, qualifications,
             authorizations, and/or cross-references to such documents.
             7.9.2.1.2. Tab 2 (if used) maintain any additional information as directed by
             MAJCOM supplement or paragraph 7.7.2.1.4.
             7.9.2.1.2. (AMC) Special Certifications. A Letter of X’s generated by the unit
             training officer, is the basic source document to provide a current history of each
             individual's flying certifications. Include all certifications not annotated on AF Form
             8 (i.e., formation lead, SIOP certification, flight examiner, initial cadre, nuclear, and
             tactical certifications, etc.). See Attachment 10 for a sample of Letter of X’s.
             7.9.2.1.3. If used, file backup electronic storage media in Section I of the FEF.
             7.9.2.1.4. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual’s flight
             record, a copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
             Flying or Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological
             Training Record, may be filed in this section behind Tab 2.
             7.9.2.1.5. (Added-AMC) Tab 2--Waivers, and Miscellaneous Information. AF
             IMTs 4025, Aircrew Summary/Closeout Report, are no longer maintained in the
             Flight Evaluation Folder. Maintain waivers in excess of two years for the effective
             period of the waiver. File miscellaneous information (i.e., AF IMT 1042 and AF IMT
             702, Individual Physiological Training Record, etc.) in Tab 2.
         7.9.2.2. Section II (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8/8a and Memos for
         Record for all evaluations listed on the AF Form 942 in Section I.
             7.9.2.2.1. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most recent on top.
             Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more mission design aircraft or two
             or more crew positions in the same mission design aircraft will file AF Forms 8/8a in
             chronological order – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                            101


          7.9.2.2.1. (AMC) See Figure 7.5 (Added). Under the AF IMT 942, maintain the
          following tabs, as required. Use AMC IMT 457, Flight Evaluation Folder Tabs. Units
          must establish procedures for maintaining the FEF (e.g., AF IMT 1042, Medical
          Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty) in the unit supplement.
          7.9.2.2.1. (MACDILL) The AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying
          or Special Operational Duty, and the AF Form 702, Individual Physiological
          Training Record, will not be maintained in individual FEFs. 6 OSS/927 OG Host
          Aviation Resource Management (HARM) will maintain these forms.

Figure 7.5. (Added-AMC) Flight Evaluation Folder Tab Requirements.




          7.9.2.2.2. Memos for record documenting waivers and extensions are filed on top of
          the affected AF Form 8/8a. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto
          the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
          Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent
          MFRs documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification (see paragraph
          7.8.5.1.1) are filed immediately above the latest affected AF Form 8/8a or, in cases
          where the memo is for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a, in
          chronological order with AF Forms 8/8a. Memos for record become a permanent part
          of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
          or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
          7.9.2.2.2. (AMC) Units may insert an appropriate cover sheet to identify AF Form 8
          previously reviewed by an ASEV team.
          7.9.2.2.3. Memos for record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF
          Form 8/8a will be filed on top of that AF Form 8/8a regardless of date the
          discrepancy is discovered.
          7.9.2.2.4. Memos for record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple
          AF Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
          7.9.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for
          evaluation program management.
   7.9.3. Description of Folders.
102                       AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009


      7.9.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
      constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
      7.9.3.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
      7.9.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSAN to the inside
      back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
      on the label if required.
      7.9.3.4. Folders must bear the ―  Privacy Act‖ statement or a ―
                                                                    For Official Use Only‖
      label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder.
  7.9.4. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
      7.9.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
      aircrew members to establish their currency and qualification prior to their first flight.
      7.9.4.1. (AMC) Initial Review. Document accomplishment with an ―     Initial Review‖
      and date entry on the AF IMT 942. For Aeromedical Evacuation, an Initial Review will
      be documented following unit of assignment and INIT QUAL/MSN entries.
         7.9.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and
         qualification of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable
         documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
         currency and qualification of the aircrew member, the unit maintaining the FEF is
         responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
         7.9.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
         stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review
         the FEF prior to their first flight.
      7.9.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a, AF
      Form 1381, or AF Form 4348 when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and
      completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility period and qualification as
      documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events were accomplished and
      requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8/8a
      contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. AF Forms 1381/4348 will be
      reviewed for correct certification signature and to ensure all previous entries are
      accounted for and are accurate. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM
      supplement.
      7.9.4.3. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit FEFs to confirm
      expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same as
      those listed in the FEFs. The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
      period window established by paragraph 5.2.6.1 unless a more restrictive review period
      is established by the MAJCOM supplement. Document the periodic review IAW unit or

     entry on the AF IMT 942. The initial review entry suffices for the annual review
     requirement.
     7.9.4.3. (MACDILL) Annual Review. Sq/DOVs will make a one-line entry for initial
     and annual reviews. Document all discrepancies either on an MFR or the FEF minor
     discrepancy log, as appropriate.
     7.9.4.4. (Added-AMC) While all AF Form 8 and AF IMTs 942 shall be retained in the
     members FEF, additional information contained in the FEF which is not related to the
     member’s current MDS(s) is considered obsolete. Obsolete documents will be returned
     to the member for their records.
  7.9.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Form 1381, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 942.
     7.9.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on
     qualification/certification.
        7.9.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
        aircrew member are considered major.
        7.9.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
        affected aircrew member are considered minor and include typos, formatting and
        misspellings.
     7.9.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Identified major discrepancies are
     documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected
     AF Form 8/8a/1381/4348, or in chronological order with the AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348
     for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348. An MFR created to
     document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the FEF once the
     information is incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner
     Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments. Memos for record become a permanent
     part of the FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
     or corrected by a later AF Form 8/8a.
     7.9.5.3. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are documented on a
     non-permanent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction.
     7.9.5.3. (MACDILL) Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Sq/DOVs will utilize a
     standardized minor discrepancy log provided by OGV to document all minor
     discrepancies.
        7.9.5.3.1. The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization
        of AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381, AF Forms 4348, and aircrew
        member FEFs.
        7.9.5.3.2. Record of minor discrepancies need not reside in the FEF.
        7.9.5.3.2. (MACDILL) The minor discrepancy log will be maintained in the FEF as
        the top sheet under Tab 2 on the left side of the FEF.
        7.9.5.3.3. Any records of minor discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior
        to any permanent change in station or status of the affected aircrew member.

                          SPECIALIZED AIRCREW PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose This chapter provides guidance for Flight Surgeons and non-rated aircrew
personnel to include K-, Q-, and X- prefix Air Force Specialty Codes. EXCEPTION: Chapter
8 does not apply to X-prefix Aeromedical Evacuation crewmembers.
8.2. Flight Surgeon.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeon Qualification. Basic initial and periodic flight surgeon qualification
   consists of an open-book examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion
   of the basic examination, flight surgeons will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal
   qualification). MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and MDS-
   Specific flight surgeon requirements. Qualification requirements will be documented on AF
   Form 8/8a. Certification requirements will be documented on AF Forms 1381/4348.
   Qualification and certification, when required, must be accomplished before flight as an
   aircrew member.
   8.2.2. Evaluations. Flight surgeon initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required)
   examinations are considered QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this
   AFI, but may be prescribed in MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
      8.2.3. Timing of Flight Surgeon Evaluations.
         8.2.3.1. Expiration Date. The required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
         17th month following the month in which the date of the AF Form 8/8a was successfully
         completed.
         8.2.3.2. Scheduling. Schedule the periodic evaluation in the eligibility period (6-month
         period prior to expiration date).
         8.2.3.3. Extended Evaluations. The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of the Flight
         Surgeon periodic evaluation up to three months on a case-by-case basis. Inform
         AFMSA/SGPA. Document extended evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.4.
   8.2.4. Requisite Completion. MAJCOMs may establish requisites for flight surgeons as
   necessary. Requisites from a completed evaluation or an examination used for re-currency
   will not be used for subsequent evaluations. All requisites for scheduled periodic evaluations
   in the eligibility period must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the
   expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
   8.2.5. Grading Policies. An overall qualification level of Q-1 will be awarded upon the
   successful completion of the flight surgeon examination(s).
   8.2.6. Flight Surgeon Failure to Complete an Evaluation Within the Required
   Period. If a flight surgeon fails to complete an evaluation prior to the qualification
   expiration date, the flight surgeon loses the qualification covered by the evaluation. The
   flight surgeon will not fly as a crew member until successful completion of the delinquent
   evaluation.

                                ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS

9.1. Flight Crew Information File Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a
current read file and publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as
listed in Table 9.1 in either hardcopy or electronic format.
9.1. (AMC) Flight Crew Information File. Information published in the FCIF is approved
and signed by OG/ OGV or designated representative. The files will be readily accessible to the
flight crew.
9.1. (MACDILL) Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). 6 OG/OGV is the primary manager
of the FCIF program for all 6 OG and 927 OG flying units. 927 OG/OGV is the secondary
manager and will assist 6 OG/OGV during periods of low manning. The master FCIF Library is
located in the 6 OG/OGV office. Copies of the FCIF Library will be maintained by 91
ARS/DOV and 310 AS/DOV. These copies will be available for crews during pre-flight mission
planning. In addition, an electronic copy will be maintained on the 6 OG/OGV Community of
Practice                        (CoP)                        website                     at
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AM-OP-01-36.
   9.1.1. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.1. (AMC) Required Volumes. The unit will develop and maintain an FCIF Library.
   At unit’s discretion, the FCIF library may be electronic, provided measures are in place to
   ensure currency of publications and unrestricted access by crewmembers. Units should
   prepare to support deployed forces with appropriate FCIF information. Units develop a
   deployment plan to successfully transfer or build a duplicate process to provide timely FCIF
   information to aircrews supporting deployed operations (i.e., Contingency, Business Effort,
   Staging, etc.) Units must advise aircrews they may receive FCIF message traffic updates
   from enroute C2 when away from home station.
       9.1.1.1. (Added-MACDILL) Established Expeditionary Squadron. If 6 AMW/927
       ARW crews are deployed to a location where a 6 AMW/927 ARW unit is not the ―          lead
       unit‖, they will utilize the FCIF file of the expeditionary unit. If a 6 AMW/927 ARW
       unit is the ―
                   lead unit‖ at the deployed location, the expeditionary Sq/CC will designate an
       FCIF monitor. This individual will maintain the expeditionary squadron’s FCIF file in
       accordance with AFI 11-202V2, and the appropriate MAJCOM/Theater supplement. The
       FCIF monitor can access/obtain FCIFs via the internet at the 6 OG/OGV CoP,
       https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/fcif.aspx, or they can contact their Sq/DOV.
       9.1.1.2. (Added-MACDILL) When off-station, the AC/Medical Crew Director (MCD)
       is responsible for ensuring their crew has obtained the latest FCIF information prior to
       flight. This can be accomplished by using the 6 OG/OGV CoP or by contacting enroute
       C2 agencies.

                   FLIGHT CREW INFORMATION FILE TEMPLATE

Note: The information below is an example of a template MAJCOMs may use when drafting an
FCIF item.
FROM: HQ AFSOC HURLBURT FLD FL//A3V//
TO:    16 OG HURLBURT FLD FL//CC/OGV//
       58 OG KIRTLAND AFB NM//DO/OGV//
       106 OG GABRESKI APRT NY//CC/OGV//
INFO: HQ AFRC ROBINS AFB GA//A3/A3V//
       NGB WASHINGTON DC//A3/A3OT//
       HQ AETC RANDOLPH AFB TX//A3/A3FV//
SUBJECT:              The Subject Line contains the FCIF number and title of the FCIF item (if
applicable)
REF A: Reference A is a location the FCIF reviewer can reference any other material, whether it
is a message or another FCIF item, pertinent to the FCIF entry. If more than one reference is
needed, use REF B, C, etc.
   1. Applicability paragraph. This paragraph lists the MAJCOM(s) that the FCIF item is
      applicable to, lists the MAJCOM(s) that will retransmit the FCIF item and those
      MAJCOMs for which the FCIF item is ―f or information only.‖
   2. Directive paragraph. FCIF authors will use this paragraph to give direction to aircrews
      regarding procedures or guidance. This information will be placed immediately following
      the applicability paragraph in order to ensure a consistent place for new procedures or
      guidance.
   3. Amplification paragraph. This paragraph should focus on background information to the
      aircrews or any other amplifying data deemed necessary by the FCIF item author for
      aircrews to understand the impetus behind the FCIF item. The FCIF item should be
      limited to one or two pages in length. Additional supporting background documentation
      should be included in attachments or references.
       a. Amplifying data may be organized into subparagraphs or follow-on paragraphs.
       b. If follow-on paragraphs are used, ensure paragraphs are numbered correctly.
   4. Administrative paragraph. Use this paragraph to show where the FCIF item is to be placed
      (Part B or C), and how for long the FCIF item is to remain in effect. Other items of an
      administrative nature may also be placed in this paragraph.
   5. Receipt/POC paragraph. This paragraph directs units to acknowledge receipt of the FCIF
      item within a desired period of time, FCIF item POC(s), and the POC phone number and
      email address.

                 RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A9.1. General. The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of
recommended changes to Air Force flying-related publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (covering completion of the form). Submit
recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to
correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF
Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF
publication OPR.
A9.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure
   A9.1 and in compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will
   utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will
   submit AF Forms 847 electronically to the maximum extent possible.
   A9.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847,
   ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review,
   forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the
   preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent
   of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels below (including the
   originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level and the originator
   advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A9.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A9.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A9.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original
   AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs,
   but may be forwarded for additional considerations if desired. MAJCOMs may address how
   to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR
   in their supplement to this instruction.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_MACDILLSUP_I 9 DECEMBER 2009                                          181


   A9.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the
   stan/eval function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no
   requirement to track receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.
