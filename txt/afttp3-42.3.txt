PURPOSE: This tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) publication provides tactical
deployed medical commanders (DMCs) guidance and procedures to plan, prepare, and employ
their assigned assets in nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) environments. Founded in joint
and Air Force counter NBC and health service support (HSS) operational level doctrine (Joint
Publication [JP] 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Environments; JP 4-02 [Final Draft], Doctrine for Health Service Support in Joint Operations;
Air Force Doctrine Document [AFDD] 2-1.8, Counter Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Operations; and AFDD 2-4.2, Health Services), this TTP provides procedures for HSS to US Air
Force operational missions. It forms the bridge between operational doctrine, other Air Force
Medical Service (AFMS) TTPs, AFMS unit type code (UTC) concepts of operations (CONOPS),
and tactical policy and guidance as referenced throughout this publication.

APPLICATION: This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel
(including Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC] and Air National Guard [ANG] units and
members). The doctrine in this document is authoritative but not directive.

SCOPE: Each forward operating location (FOL) will be unique. Medical NBC defense
operations will be deliberately planned in the base support plan (BSP), chapter 16, (refer to AFI
10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning). This TTP provides a common
operating picture to the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR), planning staff on the
notional laydown, time-phased employment, and utility of the various AFMS UTCs in NBC
environments. This TTP is warfighting doctrine, written for air and space expeditionary task
forces (AETF) in high intensity operations in high NBC threat operational areas, but it has
applicability across the spectrum of military operations.

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview.

   1.1.1. This TTP provides roles and responsibilities as well as planning and logistical
   considerations for the deployed medical commander (DMC). Although the focus of this
   document is on expeditionary medical operations in nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC)
   threat environments, it is relevant to medical commanders at main operating bases in similar
   environments. Air Force Medical Service NBC defense operations are organized in terms of
   two force health protection concepts—casualty prevention and casualty care. Casualty
   prevention operations are further categorized under the NBC passive defense concepts of
   contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control. Casualty care operations
   include patient decontamination, triage, clinical care of NBC casualties, patient movement on
   the airbase, aeromedical evacuation, and restriction of movement/quarantine. This TTP
   references other publications and resources for specific tactical details and defines education
   and training procedures for DMCs to ensure their personnel are trained and prepared to
   execute missions in NBC environments. See attachment 2 for a summary of the mission
   capability statements (MISCAPS) of NBC-related AFMS UTCs and attachment 5 for a
   reference bibliography.

   1.1.2. Air Force Health Service Support in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC)
   Environments reflects the US Air Force ground support operational environment. Air
   operations conducted in high NBC threat areas may launch from airfields that are likely
   primary targets of enemy NBC attack—air bases are lucrative targets. Air Force Medical
   Service assets support the passive defense (PD) component of Air Force operational counter
   NBC doctrine (refer to AFDD 2-1.8, Counter Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Operations), as
   well as the tactical surveillance and identification components of the cross-cutting element of
   command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and
   reconnaissance (C4ISR). Routine disease surveillance information may be the sentinel
   indication of biological agent use—early disease recognition enables intervention and
   minimizes combat capability degradation. The DMC has a need-to-know and must be
   cognizant of operational intelligence of the enemy NBC threat. The DMC and key staff need
   appropriate security clearances for access to this information and they need to be integrated
   into the AETF battlestaff and NBC Defense Cell.

   1.1.3. Biological warfare attack may create a disease mass casualty situation in the AETF.
   The DMC has the core knowledge and competency for many biological warfare passive
   defense actions. The AFMS is fielding deployable and forward-deployed assets that employ
   biotechnology to rapidly and accurately identify specific pathogens of military concern. This
   capability coupled with health surveillance systems built on advanced information
   technology and management architecture—such as the Global Expeditionary Medical System
   (GEMS)—may provide early recognition of a covert biological warfare attack and rapid
   identification of the agents, vastly improving commander situational awareness and enabling
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     5



   early intervention. Casualty prevention assets identify and quantify chemical and
   nuclear/radiological agent exposure and provide health-based operational risk assessments to
   commanders to minimize operational impact of the agents. Medical assets and information
   save lives and maximize combat effectiveness by providing critical components of the air
   base passive defense, tactical NBC surveillance and identification missions, and by treating
   and stabilizing NBC casualties.

1.2. Asymmetric Threat. Adversarial use of NBC weapons creates an asymmetric threat that
will challenge the execution of air operations. This section provides a general overview of the
types of NBC agents or materials, weapons, and their medical effects and implications. The
DMC or senior medical officer (SMO) must have access to operational and tactical intelligence
information, estimates, and resources impacting their specific area of operations in order to
effectively carry out their responsibilities and adjust medical posture based upon the threat
presented. It is imperative that all medical personnel know the command and control structure if
and when an NBC attack occurs, in order to most effectively support force health protection.
Refer to AFMAN 32-4017, Civil Engineer Readiness Technician’s Manual for Nuclear
Biological and Chemical Defense for further details.

1.3. Chemical and Biological (CB) Weapons. CB weapons are a relatively cheap force
multiplier that many nations or non-state individuals or groups are in the process of obtaining or
have already obtained. The production processes for chemical and biological weapons are very
similar to those of industrial-use chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, any country with a
developed chemical or pharmaceutical production capability has the inherent ability to produce
CB agents/weapons. The capability to produce these agents does not necessarily equate with the
ability to effectively deploy them.

1.4. Biological Warfare (BW) Agents.

   1.4.1. BW weapons can be employed by an enemy to produce mass casualties and disrupt air
   operations. These actions have the potential to significantly burden or even overwhelm
   deployed medical assets. Primary targets are support facilities such as ports, airfields, and
   industrial sites where large numbers of susceptible personnel may be exposed. Vaccines do
   not exist for all potential BW agents. Widespread and sporadic BW attacks would force a
   protective posture, thereby degrading US operational effectiveness. Feasible threats include
   development of alternate BW agents such as hemorrhagic fever viruses for which there are
   no available vaccines or effective treatment, and altering properties of bacterial, viral, and
   toxin BW agents so that current treatment is ineffective. Effective NBC defense requires
   detection, identification, and warning; individual protection and collective protection;
   hardening; and decontamination capabilities; as well as real-time health surveillance and
   epidemiology, and rapid diagnostic capability to facilitate prompt medical treatment.

   1.4.2. Due to proliferation of biological agent production capabilities and means of delivery,
   the possibility of a BW attack or exposure event poses a significant threat. Munitions that
   combine fragmentation or flechette effects can be used, inflicting conventional-type injuries
   combined with effects of biological agents. BW agent events can occur at times other than
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                      6



   deliberate hostile action, such as a BW facility accident, military strike on a BW installation,
   a covert/overt bioterrorism incident, covert contamination of food/water, or exposure
   downwind to an agent from a distant target. There may be a characteristic delay in
   symptoms that may mimic those related to endemic or common disease processes, which
   complicates warning and response. Early warning detection and rapid differential
   identification are crucial to casualty prevention and casualty care. Most infectious BW
   agents, such as Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent for anthrax, cause disease after two or
   more days in unprotected, directly exposed individuals. If not treated immediately, the
   inhalation form of the disease is usually fatal. Some agents, such as the organisms that cause
   smallpox and plague, are transmitted person to person and could initiate highly contagious
   spread beyond those directly exposed.

   1.4.3. Biological weapons include both pathogens and toxins. Pathogens are defined as
   organisms that cause disease in man and include bacteria, rickettsia, viruses, and fungi.
   Bacterial agents that produce anthrax, plague, tularemia, and Q-fever may be grown and
   exploited for military purposes. These organisms can produce a wide range of results, with
   varying degrees of morbidity and time of onset. Routes of entry include: percutaneous,
   ingestion, inhalation, and parenteral, which impact dramatically on the effective dosage of
   the agent. Alternatively, organisms can be grown to produce toxins that are exploited in
   weapons, for example, Clostridium botulinum, which produces neurotoxins that cause
   botulism. It can cause debilitating or lethal effects within a few hours of exposure, but is not
   contagious.

   1.4.4. Toxins are poisonous compounds produced by living organisms. They are usually
   proteins that act upon specific receptors in the body. Toxins can be either lethal or highly
   incapacitating, with some having potentially greater toxicity than well-known CW agents.
   Toxins are produced by a variety of organisms, including microbes, snakes, insects, spiders,
   sea creatures, and plants. Algal toxins (derived from algae) are suited for BW purposes
   because of their high toxicity, the lack of vaccines and medical treatment, and the lack of
   detection systems deployed against them.

   1.4.5. For BW agent characteristics (e.g., transmission, incubation period, persistence, etc.),
   refer to Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook published by the US Army
   Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). The handbook can be
   downloaded from their website: http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebook.html.

1.5. Chemical Warfare (CW) Agents.

   1.5.1. CW agents can be divided into four types: nerve, cyanide (blood), vesicant (blister),
   and pulmonary (choking) agents:

      1.5.1.1. Nerve agents include the G series and V series. These agents affect the nervous
      system’s ability to function correctly, thereby interrupting bodily functions such as
      breathing. Specifically, they inhibit acetylcholinesterase and the medical effects are a
      result of excess acetycholine.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   7




      1.5.1.2. Cyanides (blood agents) are absorbed into the body primarily by inhalation.
      They prevent the normal utilization of oxygen by the cells and cause rapid damage to
      body tissues. Blood agents such as hydrogen cyanide (AC) and cyanogen chloride (CK)
      are highly volatile and in the gaseous state dissipate rapidly in air.

      1.5.1.3. Vesicants (blister agents) are used primarily to cause medical casualties. These
      agents may also be used to restrict use of terrain, to slow movements, and to hamper use
      of materiel and installations. Vesicants affect the eyes and lungs and blister the skin.
      Sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and lewisite are examples of blister agents.

      1.5.1.4. Pulmonary (choking) agents are the oldest chemical warfare agents and include
      phosgene and chlorine. Because they are gases, they are nonpersistent and dissipate
      rapidly in a breeze.

   1.5.2. There are also a whole range of nonlethal agents that have been developed to include
   tear gas, vomiting agents, and incapacitating agents. These agents would generally be used
   in conjunction with lethal agents. For example, use of a vomiting agent to keep troops from
   donning protective masks would be deployed first, followed by a lethal CW agent.

   1.5.3. The effective use of chemical weapons relies on many factors including an effective
   employment strategy, a delivery platform, and the agent itself. While many nations possess
   chemical agents or the capability to produce them, few have well defined employment
   strategy to use them in any manner other than as a weapon of mass terror. A nation must also
   have a method to deliver the agent. Most conventional munitions can be modified to deliver
   lethal and nonlethal chemical agents. Typical delivery methods include: aerial bombs,
   artillery rockets, artillery shells, mortar rounds, bomblets, mines, and missile warheads.
   Chemical agents can also be dispersed using air and ground-based aerosol generators or
   sprayers. The number of casualties depends on the number of people in the area, the length of
   warning, and the degree of protection, as well as the persistency and lethality of the agent
   used. Weather and terrain are also major factors as they affect chemical agent dispersal and
   dissipation.

1.6. Nuclear Weapons/Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs).

   1.6.1. These weapons range greatly in size and energy yield and can be employed by a
   variety of means. A radiological dispersal device (RDD) is a device that contains explosives
   and radioactive material. The media often refers to this device as a “poor man’s nuclear
   weapon.” The device is intended to disperse radioactive material and does not require the
   use of sophisticated nuclear components. Deployment of a RDD could result in life
   threatening radiation injuries without the blast or heat effects that accompany a nuclear
   weapon.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     8



   1.6.2. Nuclear capability is possessed by a growing number of countries. While blast and
   thermal injury will account for most of the casualties, radiation effects will also be
   significant.

   1.6.3. A nuclear incident has the potential to instantaneously produce a very large number of
   casualties, severely burdening the entire medical evacuation and treatment system. The
   difference between conventional weapons and nuclear weapons is the different types and
   extent of injuries produced. Many of the patients injured by nuclear weapons will require
   evacuation. A patient with multiple injuries will be at extremely high risk, frequently
   requiring ventilator respiratory support. Effectiveness of treatment is related to appropriate
   supply levels and numbers of medical personnel, advanced diagnostic capability, use of
   equipment and techniques within the current standard of care, specialty consultation, medical
   information access, communication and air evacuation, and ability to process tests and data
   rapidly. Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) released by the blast may disrupt communications,
   computers, and biomedical equipment and certainly could have medical impact.

   1.6.4. In addition to the effects of blast, heat, and radiation on equipment, personnel,
   facilities, and communications, the psychological effects of such weapons are enormous.
   Potential for a mass casualty situation is significant.

1.7. Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs).

   1.7.1. There is a growing concern that the wide availability of many TICs and TIMs makes
   them potential tools for attacks against our forces. While relatively benign and not usually
   considered a primary threat, these materials are generally available from commercial sources
   and can be easily obtained in large quantities. Their release could cause casualties or disrupt
   operations. Gases and vapors can pose serious atmospheric health or explosive hazards,
   whereas liquids and solids may be used to contaminate potable water or food supplies. Some
   materials may be made more toxic with relatively simple chemical modifications. Hostile
   forces could target industrial plants, agricultural warehouses, or treatment facilities located
   on or near a deployed site. TIC/TIM examples include: insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers,
   and the raw chemicals/solvents used to manufacture them (i.e., chlorine gas, acids, etc.);
   petrochemical facilities (explosive gases, flammable liquids); nuclear materials (research
   laboratories, nuclear medicine, nuclear power plants); and research laboratories (chemical
   and biological materials).

   1.7.2. Depending on the type and quantity of TICs/TIMs, a deliberate release could present a
   short- or long-term hazard at the release site and for those within the downwind chemical
   plume. They would disperse similarly as chemical warfare agents. The vapors tend to
   remain concentrated downwind from the release point and in natural low-lying areas such as
   valleys, ravines, or man-made underground structures. High concentrations may remain in
   buildings, woods, or any area with low air circulation. They can be stable and persistent.
   Immediate evacuation outside the hazard’s path is the best course of action in case of
   TIC/TIM release.

  1.7.3. The protective mask, ensemble, and military standard collective protection (CP) filters
  may provide only limited protection. Shelter-in-place procedures may be ineffective for
  certain toxic gases. The greatest risk from a large-scale toxic chemical release occurs when
  personnel receive little or no warning, are unable to escape the immediate area, and are
  overcome. Refer to the following for planning and response guidelines: AFI 10-2501
  [Draft], Full Spectrum Threat Response Operations; AFH 10-2502, WMD Threat Planning
  and Response Handbook; AFMAN 32-4002, Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning and
  Response Program; AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and

                 COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS

2.1. Command and Control. Command and control of Air Force medical assets is vested in
the line of the Air Force (LAF). The information in this chapter is consistent with AFDD 2,
Organization and Employment of Aerospace Power, and AFTTP 3-42.1 [Draft], Medical
Command and Control.

2.2. Operational Command Relationships.

   2.2.1. The air and space expeditionary task force (AETF) is the designated US Air Force
   organization to fulfill the joint task force (JTF) and joint forces air component commander
   (JFACC) campaign objectives. Within the AETF organizational structure, expeditionary
   wings, groups, and squadrons are established to provide administrative control (ADCON) of
   air force forces.

   2.2.2. An AETF encompasses all US Air Force forces assigned or attached to the JTF and
   includes other forces dedicated to the JTF mission provided via reachback. The command
   element includes the AETF commander (the COMAFFOR), a staff, and a command and
   control (C2) function. The joint force commander (JFC) should delegate operational control
   (OPCON) of assigned/attached US Air Force forces to the COMAFFOR. The COMAFFOR
   typically does not delegate OPCON to subordinate commanders.

   2.2.3. The supported air component will establish command relationships within an AETF in
   the tasking orders. Medical force packages deployed into the theater of operations should be
   activated by special order as an expeditionary medical squadron or group, unless attached to
   a larger medical unit (a small logistics team may be attached to an expeditionary medical
   operations squadron [EMOS]). Deployed medical forces should be under the operational
   control of the COMAFFOR, who also exercises specified ADCON over these forces when
   attached.

   2.2.4. Medical force packages may be designated by tasking order as deployed in direct
   support to an expeditionary unit; or in general support to multiple units, or to the entire
   theater. As an example, an EMOS may be deployed to Base-X in direct support of the host
   wing and should be attached to that wing for ADCON purposes. A theater epidemiological
   team (TET), or other expeditionary medical support (EMEDS)-independent UTCs, may also
   be deployed to Base-X and be attached to the same wing for ADCON purposes but tasked in
   general support to the theater under operational control of the COMAFFOR.

2.3. Operational Communications.

   2.3.1. The Annex K and Annex Q of the operation plan (OPLAN) detail the communications
   architecture between echelons of command and between supported and supporting units, and
   provide security procedures and frequencies. In cases where no OPLAN is published, the
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                11



  tasking order should provide communications detail or it is determined in predeployment
  planning between the DMC and the supported Air Force forces (AFFOR) Surgeon (SG) for
  medical communications such as between DMC and the patient movement requirements
  center [PMRC] and within the deploying aerospace expeditionary force (AEF) for internal
  communications. It is critical to ensure that communications assets and systems are
  compatible with systems used in the theater of operations.

  2.3.2. A wing staff is usually established at the air expeditionary wing (AEW) level to
  provide ADCON support to attached forces. This staff provides personnel, intelligence,
  operations, logistics, plans, and communications support. Upon beddown, it is important for
  the DMC to establish a support relationship with the wing staff. The medical logistics
  noncommissioned officer (NCO) needs to know how to access logistics support. The
  medical communications NCO needs access to communications and systems support.
  However, the AEW’s staff likely has no medical representative to provide medical-unique
  support. Therefore, upon beddown it is critical for the DMC to reestablish communication
  with the AFFOR Surgeon’s staff for medical-unique logistics support, medical intelligence,
  and functional guidance. This relationship should already exist from communications during
  predeployment planning.

  2.3.3. In a high-threat NBC area, the communications architecture includes lines of
  communication among deployed combat units, medical units tasked with medical care, and
  specialized units providing NBC detection and warning functions, either in direct support to
  deployed unit, or in general support to several units or the theater. The DMC must
  understand this NBC-related communications architecture to effectively gain NBC threat
  intelligence and associated guidance, and to upchannel information and data for analysis by
  specialized teams tasked with NBC surveillance functions.            Chapter 4, “Planning
  Considerations,” addresses specialized NBC teams and their lines of communication.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                  12



                                       Chapter 3

                         ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Deployed Medical Commander (DMC) or Senior Medical Officer (SMO). The DMC or
SMO will face medical tasks unprecedented in modern American warfare in the event of an NBC
attack on an air base. Mass casualty situations inherently exceed the capability of normal
medical care and NBC events may further stress these systems to the point of breaking.
Therefore, the DMC must aggressively plan and prepare prior to an event in order to provide
appropriate force health protection to the wing mission and to prepare his/her unit’s ability to
operate in NBC environments. Ensuring AETF mission success is paramount—proper planning,
aggressive casualty prevention programs integrated into the wing mission, triage and life saving
activities will minimize the effect of adversary use of NBC weapons and contribute to AETF
mission success. This chapter describes roles, responsibilities, and tasks for DMCs and senior
personnel during predeployment, deployment, and postdeployment to NBC high threat areas.
Predeployment is assumed to start upon receipt of a warning order or other notification of
imminent deployment.

3.2. DMC Medical Planning.

    3.2.1. The DMC’s assets and capabilities must be fully integrated into the wing mission to
ensure mission success. There will be a variety of in-place and/or deployed medical assets and
capabilities. The DMC will use this TTP, other TTPs in the 3-42 series, AFMAN 10-2602
[Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and
Standards, UTC CONOPS, local plans, line of the AF guidance, and their operational knowledge
and experience to employ limited resources to support the wing mission and assure effective
passive defense in an NBC attack. In most cases, NBC planning and response are coordinated
through the AETF survival recovery center (SRC) by the Civil Engineer Readiness Officer
and/or NCO. The DMC, as a member of the battlestaff, must ensure the AETF knows and
understands the medical capabilities and constraints in NBC environments and the requirements
of the deployed medical facility (DMF) to support the wing mission in NBC environments. The
DMC should ensure a Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) or NCO (if available) is tasked to the
SRC to serve as the health risk assessor and command advisor for nuclear, biological, and
chemical attacks and recovery actions. The biological augmentation team (BAT) or theater
epidemiology team (TET) can be consulted for preliminary biological agent identification and
consultation. Additionally, the assigned public health officer is a resource for BW agent
consultation regarding the medical effects, epidemiology, prevention and control, surveillance,
vaccination, prophylaxis and treatment. When this specialty is not locally available, the DMC
should contact the COMAFFOR for guidance and support. Refer to AFH 32-4014, Vol 1, USAF
Operations in a Chemical and Biological (CB) Warfare Environment, CB Planning and
Analysis, for specific guidance on how the wing NBC SRC is normally organized. (Note: AFH
32-4014 will be superseded by AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and
Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards.)

    3.2.2. DMCs must know and understand the operational concept and intent of their
commanders and the COMAFFOR as expressed in the various OPLANs/operation orders
(OPORDs) and annexes (Annex Q and other NBC relevant annexes). Communication between
the DMC (through their chain of command) and the COMAFFOR’s staff should ensure that the
DMC fully understands and is able to support the mission with assigned resources. DMC
reporting should include any limiting factors (LIMFACS) through medical reports (MEDREPs)
and/or situation reports (SITREPs). The DMC must create and maintain a communications link
with the AFFOR Surgeon and ensure health surveillance reporting requirements are
implemented.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                    14



                                           Chapter 4

                              PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS

4.1. Operational Planning. Operational doctrine for the employment of AFMS deployable
assets is in development. The Air Force theater medical system operates within the AETF and
JTF structures to support combatant commander objectives. When the threat of NBC use is high,
a robust expeditionary NBC structure is required to support the mission. To assist operational
planners and the AFFOR Surgeon as they develop contingency specific medical CONOPS in
support of joint force commander (JFC) deliberate and crisis action plans, this document offers
the following planning guidance for employment of AFMS assets in NBC environments.
Planners must review and understand the MISCAPS and CONOPS of the various AFMS UTCs
to fully understand how best to employ them. Attachment 2 is a summary of the UTC MISCAPS
with NBC relevance.

4.2. Commander, AFFOR (COMAFFOR). COMAFFOR medical assets—both NBC
specialty and general casualty care—are available to provide health service support in the theater
of operations. Using his/her operational knowledge and experience, the COMAFFOR must
balance available lift and time against the NBC and conventional threats to lay down medical
assets at theater and wing levels to maximize health service support. Medical UTCs are
modularized and employed incrementally using a tiered approach with a tailored response based
upon mission requirements, medical threat, and population at risk (PAR). Increasing NBC and
other medical threats should be considered when evaluating the proper order of buildup of
capabilities. In operations where the planner cannot lay down a more robust medical NBC
capability, they should use a hub and spoke concept and utilize opportune transportation to
support far forward locations. This approach increases response time and NBC risk at each
location and must be balanced against lift constraints and NBC threat in the theater and at each
operating location.

4.3. Medical Unit Type Code (UTC) Laydown. Successful NBC attacks may produce mass
casualty events. When the AFFOR theater medical concept of operations is developed, planners
must consider the risk of NBC attack and the increased burden on medical infrastructure. The
medical laydown and CONOPS for NBC environments should be seamless and consistent with
non-NBC CONOPS to the extent possible. The same building block approach should be used,
where medical NBC-specific assets are laid over conventional medical assets. The flow of these
assets into the theater must be driven by the mission needs of the JFC and relative medical
threats.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                                    15




   4.3.1. The operational planner should understand the capabilities and limiting factors
   (LIMFACS) of the UTCs when planning health service support (HSS) throughout the theater
   of operations in NBC environments (refer to UTC CONOPS, MISCAPS, and Allowance
   Standards). The medical UTCs and their potential application in NBC environments are
   listed in Table 4.1. Unless otherwise indicated, without CP, UTCs will be unable to treat
   casualties in chemical contaminated environments and may suffer operational degradation in
   radiological or biological environments.

       Note 1—Clinical capabilities from squadron medical elements (SMEs) and independent duty
       medical technicians (IDMTs) will provide only minimal ability to treat and care for NBC
       casualties, and these assets do not have CP systems. Without CP, their ability to treat casualties in
       NBC environments will be limited. CP begins at the EMEDS Basic level. The contingency
       aeromedical staging facility (CASF)/mobile aeromedical staging facility (MASF) do not currently
       have CP and any patients awaiting movement during an attack will require individual protective
       equipment (IPE) or protective patient wraps.
       Note 2—The population at risk (PAR) will determine if Basic, +10, or +25 bed sizes are adequate.
       [Note the definition of PAR as it is used in this document; not to be confused with NBC defense
       personnel’s use of the acronym to mean post-attack reconnaissance.]
       Note 3—The combat stress team, the theater epidemiology team, and the Air Force radiation
       assessment team (AFRAT) are deployed in general support of the theater of operations rather than
       as direct support installation-level medical assets.
       Note 4—The PAM and SPEARR teams are organic to the EMEDS packages and have limited
       NBC defense capabilities and resources. Although these teams may already be in place or may be
       deployed to a NBC environment, these assets should not be intentionally deployed alone.

                staging facility (ASF)/mobile aeromedical staging facility (MASF) will have limited
                clinical capabilities in contaminated environments. Commanders of these assets must
                plan and prepare to cease shirtsleeve clinical care and don individual protective
                equipment (IPE) (both medical personnel and patients) upon chemical or biological
                attack. Upon attack warning, medical personnel will place patients who cannot wear IPE

      due to their injuries in NBC protective wraps (if available) and continue lifesaving care to
      the greatest extent possible.

      4.3.2.2. Commanders of medical assets must preplan alternate facilities, as well as
      route/mode of evacuation for contaminated casualties, in the event their infrastructure is
      contaminated with persistent chemical agents. Casualty prevention-oriented UTCs
      should arrive prior to treatment-oriented UTCs, once basic medical care coverage (e.g.,
      SME, PAM, IDMT, etc.) is in place on site. Prevention through disease surveillance and
      risk management may limit exposed populations. Wartime Medical Decontamination
      Teams (WMDTs), and/or local line/medical personnel and materiel of opportunity will be
      used to provide patient decontamination should the need occur. Two FFGLB teams may
      be required to sustain 24-hour patient decontamination capability.

   4.3.3. Figure 4.2 illustrates the beddown to support a medical CONOPS that uses squadron
   medical elements (SMEs) at forward operating bases. They are supported by mobile trauma
   stabilization and fixed-wing aeromedical evacuation (AE) from the Level 3 deployed medical
   facility at the intratheater airlift hub. Base B has organic EMEDS Basic support due to a
   larger PAR and distance from the airlift hub.

   4.3.4. The beddown in Figure 4.3 supports the same medical CONOPS as in Figure 4.2 but
   adds medical NBC capability to account for the high NBC threat. Two patient
   decontamination teams with one equipment set, one biological augmentation team, one
   bioenvironmental engineering NBC team, and one augmented infectious disease team (IDT)
   provide direct support to the CP EMEDS+25 at the airlift hub and provide general support to
   specific forward operating locations.          One patient decontamination team with
   decontamination equipment (FFGLA) is attached to the EMEDS Basic at Base B, due to the
   distance from the airlift hub. Additionally, one theater epidemiology team and a radiological
   assessment team are attached to the wing at the airlift hub for ADCON, but are in general
   support to the theater under OPCON of the COMAFFOR (refer to paragraphs 2.2.2. and
   2.2.3.).

   4.3.5. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 are meant to illustrate that AFMS NBC capability must be laid in
   on existing non-NBC UTCs. The notional laydown illustrated in these figures are intended
   for the PARs listed. PARs will be highly variable based on site-specific environments. The
   medical capability at each location must be appropriately matched to the PAR.

4.4. Casualty Estimates. The joint tool approved for calculating medical requirements is the
medical analysis tool (MAT). MAT does not now include the capability to generate medical
requirements for NBC casualties. The Joint Readiness Clinical Advisory Board (JRCAB) is
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     19



developing Task, Time, and Treater files for use in the MAT for various NBC casualty profiles.
These files can be used to determine Class VIII equipment and supply requirements. The
Services are responsible for generating casualty estimates and tracking casualty rates for
contingency operations. In the Air Force, this is the responsibility of the planning and operations
communities.

4.5. Protective Measures with Treatment Areas. The senior Air Force commander may
delegate the authority to determine Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) levels and other
protective measures within medical areas or sectors to the DMC or SMO. To implement this
action, the medical facility must have the capability to provide NBC detection and identification
capabilities similar to that provided by Civil Engineer NBC Reconnaissance Teams. This
authority, if exercised, must be personally delegated by the senior Air Force commander. The
medical staff must also verify with the NBC defense cell that medical areas are not within the
downwind vapor plume of an agent disposition area. Medical personnel will conduct detection,
monitoring, and contamination assessment within these designated areas. See AFMAN 10-2602
[Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and
Standards for additional information on protective measures and MOPP. (Refer to paragraph
5.4.8 for details).

4.6. Tactical Planning.

   4.6.1. Predeployment Planning Considerations and Responsibilities (In-Garrison).
   Most of these actions should have been accomplished prior to receiving the warning order—
   the intent of this section is to serve as a reminder to the DMC to ensure his forces are
   prepared to deploy, quickly reach initial operational capability (IOC), and conduct their
   mission. The deploying medical commander is responsible for preparing medical forces to
   deploy and providing force health protection guidance to the deploying wing commander for
   use in the development of wing deployment plans.

       4.6.1.1. Medical Deployment Plans. Request and review the COMAFFOR’s
       supporting plan to the combatant commander’s operation plan, the NBC passive defense
       plans, the OPLAN Annex Q, the deliberate plans from the beddown base (Base X
       Disaster Preparedness Plan 32-1 [refer to AFI 32-4001, Disaster Preparedness Planning
       and Operations to be superseded by AFI 10-2501 (Draft), Full Spectrum Threat
       Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations], the medical contingency response plan
       (MCRP) [refer to AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training] or equivalent,
       and the Base X Support Plan [refer to AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site
       Planning]).

       4.6.1.2. Predeployment Plan. This plan defines how the medical force will arrive at the
       beddown location, detailing tasks required to set-up and achieve IOC status. Based on
       tasking order direction and the NBC threat assessment, the DMC considers NBC passive
       defense measures in generating the beddown plan. In the chronology of beddown
       actions, the deploying DMC should determine when detection, surveillance, protective,
       and decontamination capabilities need to be operational, driving beddown task priorities
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   20



     and assignments. Specifically, when multiple medical UTCs deploy as a force package,
     the DMC must determine the balance between casualty care and NBC detection/defense
     capabilities when tasking work details to orchestrate set-up. Key tasks to be prioritized
     by threat and command direction:

        4.6.1.2.1. Establish chemical detection and reporting capability for the DMF within
        medical areas or sectors.

        4.6.1.2.2. Establish NBC sampling capability.

        4.6.1.2.3. Establish pathogen identification capability.

        4.6.1.2.4. Establish radiation detection capability to ensure DMF is equipped to
        detect radiation if unit is deployed in a location where a nuclear/radiological threat is
        expected.

        4.6.1.2.5. Initiate medical surveillance to support early biological agent detection and
        disease and nonbattle injury (DNBI) reporting.

        4.6.1.2.6. Establish communication links with medical intelligence and NBC
        reporting systems.

        4.6.1.2.7. Establish medical collection protection capability where available.

        4.6.1.2.8. Establish patient decontamination capability.

        4.6.1.2.9. Determine PAR and any NBC casualty estimates.

        4.6.1.2.10. Tailor personnel and equipment to meet JFC and COMAFFOR required
        capabilities.

        4.6.1.2.11. Ensure appropriate deploying unit NBC training has occurred.

        4.6.1.2.12. NBC and Conventional Defense Training (NBCCDT) and self-aid/buddy
        care (SABC)—ensure all personnel can don/doff mission-oriented protection posture
        (MOPP) gear and conduct mission essential tasks at appropriate MOPP levels. Refer
        to AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, and AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection
        and Attack Actions (to be superceded by AFMAN 10-2601 [Draft], Counter NBC
        Operations and Standards), for specific actions.

        4.6.1.2.13.  UTC specific—ensure mission specific UTC training has been
        accomplished (refer to AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training).

        4.6.1.2.14. Identify NBC-related shortfalls/LIMFACS to wing and major command
        (MAJCOM).
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                  21




     4.6.1.3. Civil Engineer (CE) Support. Medical and CE personnel work together to
     provide the base with a fully integrated NBC defense capability. The specific roles and
     responsibilities of medical and CE UTCs are described in Attachment 6, NBC Defense–
     Related Task Summary. The DMC should coordinate with CE Readiness when
     integrating NBC considerations into the beddown plan. This coordination prevents
     duplication of effort and closes capability gaps. CE support may reduce the time required
     to establish medical care capability by allowing the DMC to emphasize casualty care set-
     up first.

     4.6.1.4. Load Plan. Based on beddown plan priorities and the time-phased flow of
     medical materiel and personnel, the DMC coordinates with the wing’s logistics planner to
     generate a load plan. The plan enables beddown in an NBC area by deliberately flowing
     NBC passive defense capabilities into the beddown location at the most appropriate time
     in the wing’s overall materiel and personnel flow schedule.

     4.6.1.5. Wing Deployment Plans. The DMC uses NBC threat assessments to formulate
     force health protection recommendations to the deploying wing commander. Some force
     health protection actions may be clearly specified in the JFC’s tasking order.
     Considerations include prophylaxis and vaccinations, medical screening criteria, and
     medical threat briefings to establish individual risk management procedures. Key tasks:

        4.6.1.5.1. Provide guidance to deploying forces on appropriate NBC force health
        protection (FHP) actions.

        4.6.1.5.2. Ensure vaccinations are administered and chemical prophylaxes are issued.

        4.6.1.5.3. Ensure NBC related combat stress issues are addressed/considered.

        4.6.1.5.4. Ensure deploying forces are current in self-aid and buddy care (SABC).

        4.6.1.5.5. Receive joint operations area specific threat brief from wing intelligence.

        4.6.1.5.6. Ensure deploying forces are trained and equipped to meet those threats.

        4.6.1.5.7. Ensure senior medical staff fully understands medical effects and
        ramifications of the enemy order of battle and operational environment.

        4.6.1.5.8. Conduct predeployment health assessments of deploying forces (DD Form
        2795) in accordance with (IAW) combatant commander and MAJCOM requirements
        (refer to CJCS Memo MCM 0006-02, Updated Procedures for Deployment Health
        Surveillance and Readiness).

        4.6.1.5.9. Provide medical intelligence analysis and briefings to commanders and
        deploying forces.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   22




  4.6.2. Deployment Considerations and Responsibilities. Upon beddown, the DMC
  generates or refines the existing Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP) to tailor
  execution details to the specific mission, NBC threat, location, and conditions consistent with
  Base X Support Plan. Also, the DMC provides medical representation to wing battlestaff and
  survival recovery center (SRC) and NBC Defense Cell tasked with generating or refining the
  wing’s NBC contingency plans. Refinement of the wing’s plans will cause further
  refinement of the supporting MCRP.

     4.6.2.1. Key DMC actions upon beddown of deployed medical assets and capabilities:

         4.6.2.1.1. Conduct a vulnerability analysis. Consider intelligence information and
         enemy threat assessments, meteorological data, terrain information, and the tactical
         order of battle of the beddown air base. Coordinate with wing operations and CE
         Readiness to determine casualty estimates. Additional information is addressed in
         chapter 5, “Casualty Prevention.”

         4.6.2.1.2. Determine specific actions, procedures, and materiel to maximize NBC
         contamination avoidance.

         4.6.2.1.3. Evaluate the location of the DMF relevant to base operations in NBC
         environment—CW sectoring, NBC detection and reporting network, patient
         movement, and patient decontamination are relevant issues for the DMC and staff to
         consider.

         4.6.2.1.4. Implement or change deliberate planning factors (Base X Support Plan,
         Base OPLAN 10-2, or equivalent). Develop medical NBC related plans (MCRP or
         equivalent) supporting the wing NBC passive defense plans and consider mutual
         support arrangements with other coalition and host-nation medical facilities.

         4.6.2.1.5. Integrate into wing NBC threat working group and the survival recovery
         center (SRC)—assign medical representatives to battlestaff and SRC.

         4.6.2.1.6. Receive and assess local NBC threat and intelligence briefings—posture
         DMF to meet the threat.

         4.6.2.1.7. Establish communication and procedures with the patient movement
         requirements center (PMRC) for patient movement of NBC casualties.

     4.6.2.2. Review casualty prevention responsibilities (see chapter 5, “Casualty
     Prevention,” for detailed procedures):

         4.6.2.2.1. Employ and conduct medical/environmental surveillance and disease-early
         warning. Employ the GEMS or other surveillance system as approved for use by the
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                23



        supported combatant commander. Ensure/establish mechanism for reporting medical
        information that may indicate covert BW agent attack to commanders and the SRC.

        4.6.2.2.2. Conduct health-based NBC risk assessments and advise commander.
        Continuously review and update these assessments as necessary.

        4.6.2.2.3. Conduct sampling and analyses to identify, evaluate, record, and report
        NBC agent and occupational and environmental exposures.

        4.6.2.2.4. Conduct a food and water vulnerability assessment. Take appropriate
        countermeasures to protect the food and water supply from possible sabotage or
        inadvertent contamination.

        4.6.2.2.5.   Provide vaccines, prophylaxes and postexposure countermeasures
        consistent with theater directives.

        4.6.2.2.6. Conduct baseline vector surveillance to identify local vectors of disease
        and potential breeding sites.

        4.6.2.2.7. Capture medical and environmental exposure data. Ensure procedures are
        maintained for appropriate reporting and archiving of health surveillance data and
        reports. Document notable exposures in individual health records.

        4.6.2.2.8. Conduct or arrange for BW agent presumptive identification and diagnosis.

        4.6.2.2.9. Implement the transportation mechanism for shipping samples to
        laboratories for definitive analyses that cannot be accomplished by local assets.

        4.6.2.2.10. CP of medical materiel and assets. Operate deployed CP EMEDS+10/25.
        Plan for alternate DMF in the event the existing facility is contaminated and rendered
        unusable.

     4.6.2.3. Review casualty care responsibilities (see chapter 6, “Casualty Care and
     Management,” for detailed procedures):

        4.6.2.3.1. Provide casualty management consistent with deployed level of casualty
        care, logistical tail, and available CP.

        4.6.2.3.2. Establish patient decontamination policy. Decontamination of casualties
        minimizes the detrimental effects of contamination, protects those who move and
        treat them, and prevents contamination of the medical facility. Units and individuals
        have primary responsibility for decontamination during the self-aid and buddy care
        process (i.e., M-291 kits). This should be done as soon as contamination is found and
        prior to moving them to the medical facility—quick action saves lives. Upon
        completion of SABC efforts and first responder actions, contaminated casualties
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                               24



        should be moved into the medical treatment system as soon as possible, even if
        decontamination is not complete. The medical facility will plan for and provide
        patient decontamination.    The wartime patient decontamination team (UTC
        FFGLA/FFGLB) provides this capability. Medical units without a WMDT may need
        to establish decontamination capability using line and/or medical personnel and
        materiel of opportunity.

        4.6.2.3.3. Establish ground movement policy for NBC casualties on the air base.

        4.6.2.3.4. Recommend restriction of movement and quarantine procedures for
        infectious biological warfare agent casualties as well as for relevant vectors and
        fomites.

        4.6.2.3.5. Ensure availability of vehicles and establish routes for movement of
        contaminated casualties to the DMF.

        4.6.2.3.6. Establish contaminated casualty flow routes within the DMF area.

  4.6.3. Postdeployment Considerations and Responsibilities.

     4.6.3.1. Prior to redeployment, ensure postdeployment health assessments (DD Form
     2796) are completed. Particular emphasis on actual or perceived environmental
     exposures to NBC agents or materials should be highlighted.

     4.6.3.2. Prior to redeployment, ensure environmental surveillance data addressing
     perceived environmental exposures has been properly documented and stored through
     systems such as GEMS and Command Core.

     4.6.3.3. Continue medical treatment of casualties per established treatment protocols.
     Thorough and accurate documentation of exposures and any treatments received is of
     paramount importance.

     4.6.3.4. Monitor redeploying Service members for the duration of the latency period of
     the biological threat agents of concern as indicated by intelligence assessments.

     4.6.3.5. Write and transmit lessons learned IAW Service requirements and the Joint
     Uniform Lessons Learned System (JULLS).

                              CASUALTY PREVENTION

5.1. Overview.

  5.1.1. Casualty prevention is an NBC passive defense force multiplier focusing on threats
  posed by enemy forces and complex endemic and environmental health threats. Failure to
  counter these threats jeopardizes mission accomplishment.

     5.1.1.1. Enemy Threat. The enemy threat depends on the enemy’s willingness and
     ability to use conventional and nonconventional weapons systems; munitions; and
     nuclear, biological, and chemical agents (NBC).             Aggressive application of
     countermeasures enhances the force’s ability to minimize combat injuries, combat and
     operational stress reactions, and exposure to NBC agents or materials.

     5.1.1.2. Health Threat. The health threat depends on a complex set of environmental
     and occupational factors that combine to produce disease and nonbattle injury (DNBI).

  5.1.2. Casualty prevention is an integral part of counter NBC defense operations through
  passive defense and tactical surveillance. Information provided by ongoing health
  surveillance and DNBI reporting is critical to counter NBC defense operations. Passive
  defense protects personnel from the effects of an NBC attack and improves the
  capability of personnel to survive and sustain operations in an NBC environment. The
  three passive defense measures are contamination avoidance, protection, and
  contamination control. This chapter provides information to the DMC or SMO on casualty
  prevention responsibilities and actions during predeployment, deployment, and
  postdeployment.

  5.1.3. Passive defense includes force health protection measures, a process that begins
  before deployment, and encompasses the entire deployment scenario including contamination
  avoidance, protection, and contamination control. Preparations for operations in potential
  NBC environments begin early in predeployment and include threat assessments, medical
  screening, preexposure immunizations, pretreatments, prophylaxis, quantitative fit testing
  (QNFT) and risk-based training on the ability to survive and operate (ATSO) in NBC
  environments.

  5.1.4. During deployment the casualty prevention aspects of passive defense must be
  aggressively pursued and institutionalized throughout the base and deployed medical facility
  operation to maximize combat effectiveness. Health surveillance may provide the first
  indication of biological warfare attack. Chemoprophylaxis may be the sole defense
  sustaining an affected force and could very well be the critical combat force multiplier.
  Casualty prevention seeks to provide the line commander the best available health-based risk
  assessment of the tactical situation—improving his/her situational awareness and enabling
  the warfighter.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                26




5.2. Predeployment Actions.

   5.2.1. Medical Estimate of Situation.

      5.2.1.1. Casualty prevention initiatives using passive defense measures are planned for
      early in the predeployment planning process. The Public Health Officer (PHO)/NCO or
      designated Medical Intelligence Officer (MIO), in conjunction with the medical NBC
      defense officer and the NBC casualty management officer, evaluates the supported
      operation/mission and all aspects of the deployed location (additional information on
      roles and responsibilities are found in AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and
      Training). The theater air component provides the medical estimate of the situation to
      deploying bases, usually through reporting instructions to the personnel readiness unit
      (PRU) or Wing Plans (XP). The PHO/MIO at the deployed base uses this information to
      generate detailed medical threat information with their associated countermeasures and
      provides this information to deploying forces to minimize battle and DNBI. Refer to
      Annex Q of pertinent deliberate/crisis OPLAN or OPORD. The DMC must review the
      medical estimate prior to deployment to adequately plan for the deployed medical threat.

      5.2.1.2. Medical threat is the composite of all ongoing or potential enemy actions and
      environmental conditions that will reduce combat effectiveness through wounding,
      injuring, disease, and/or degrading performance. Weapons or environmental conditions
      that will generate wounded, injured, and sick personnel, beyond the capability of the
      medical system to provide timely medical care from available resources, are considered
      major medical threats. Weapons or environmental conditions that produce qualitatively
      different wound or disease processes are also major medical threats. Elements of medical
      threat are used to define the vulnerability of and the risk to deployed forces. Medical
      threats from both environmental and adversary sources are shown below in Table 5.1.

Table 5.1. Medical Threats from Environmental and Adversary Sources

         Environmental Sources                          Adversary Sources
Naturally occurring diseases                Small arms and fragmentation ordnance and
                                            munitions
Hazardous plants and animals                Biological warfare agents

                                            Directed-energy devices
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                               27




  5.2.2. Casualty Prevention Measures. The DMC must ensure that all of the following
  predeployment actions are accomplished prior to deployment:

     5.2.2.1. Immunizations. Immunizations are provided IAW AFJI 48-110, Immunizations
     and Chemoprophylaxis. DOD is working to position sufficient quantities of vaccine to
     protect the force from suspected BW agents. When vaccines are available to protect
     against a validated BW threat, it is DOD policy (DODD 6205.3, DOD Immunization
     Program for Biological Warfare Defense) that personnel will be immunized with
     sufficient time to develop immunity before deployment to threat areas. [Ensure
     investigational new drug (IND) protocols are followed, if applicable.]

     5.2.2.2. Chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis for some biological and chemical
     agents is available and will be issued at the time of deployment IAW theater policy or
     issued from bulk storage at forward deployed locations (see chapter 7, “Logistics”).
     Theater deployers must be trained prior to deployment on the proper use of these
     preventive measures. Examples include nerve agent pretreatment, nerve agent antidote
     kits, and antibiotics. [Ensure IND protocols are followed, if applicable.]

     5.2.2.3. Medical Threat Briefing. The MIO will brief deploying troops on the deployed
     medical threat including: environmental hazards, endemic diseases, hazardous insects,
     plants, and animals, NBC threat, and appropriate countermeasures. MIO guidance is
     found in AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training. Medical intelligence is
     available from many sources. The primary source is the Armed Forces Medical
     Intelligence Center (AFMIC); however, the MIO should also acquire and be cognizant of
     current operational intelligence of the NBC threat at the deployment location. The
     medical threat briefing should be provided sufficiently early (ideally at the concept
     briefing, and directly to the troops) to permit deploying troops to pack needed clothing
     and supplies and to take appropriate actions prior to deployments.

     5.2.2.4. Medical NBC Defense Officer Briefing. The Bioenvironmental Engineer
     (BEE) (or NCO) in the SRC or Command Post should provide information on medical
     aspects of the NBC threat and related passive defense measures at the deployment
     location. The quantitative fit training (QNFT) of protective masks provides training to
     personnel deploying to medium and high NBC threat environments on the fit-factor
     protective levels and the best way to don their individual mask which gives them
     confidence that it fits properly. Refer to AFMAN 32-4006, Nuclear, Biological, and
     Chemical (NBC) Mask Fit Liquid Hazard Simulant Training for procedural guidance for
     administering quantitative fit training (QNFT) using the M-41 Protection Assessment
     Test System (PATS). Also important is the availability and capabilities of radiological,
     chemical and biological agent detectors in theater.

     5.2.2.5. Predeployment Medical Questionnaire. All deploying troops must be
     administered a predeployment medical questionnaire IAW CJCS Memo MCM 0006-02,
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   28



       Updated Procedures for Deployment Health Surveillance and Readiness, to establish
       their predeployment health status baseline.

5.3. Deployment Actions. The DMC/SMO should be intimately knowledgeable with the
capabilities of the various medical UTCs assigned to the DMF and the local medical capabilities
at the deployed location and the reachback capability provided by medical assets assigned to
support the theater. Reference Attachment 2 for a description of the NBC related UTC
MISCAPS. The DMC has specific passive defense responsibilities to ensure casualty prevention
during all phases of deployment. The deployment phase consists of pre-attack, trans-attack, and
post-attack postures.

5.4. Deployment Phase: Pre-attack Casualty Prevention Measures.

   5.4.1. Site Selection: The DMC in conjunction with the Civil Engineer commander ensures
   optimal site selection and deployment of medical assets. The DMC should consult the
   preventive medicine assets (i.e., PHO/PH technician, BEE, IDMT, flight surgeon, SME, etc.)
   as these people have the expertise and training in site selection. The DMC must employ
   operational risk management techniques to balance the mission needs of patient movement
   against the threat of attack and contamination avoidance. For example, move the CP
   EMEDS to a position that enables the deployed medical facility to stage patients for AE
   while negating potential casualty movement bottlenecks at non-CP MASFs. Refer to
   AFPAM 10-219 Vol 5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning Guide, for specific considerations
   related to site selection.

   5.4.2. Health Surveillance and DNBI Reporting: The single most effective tool for
   identifying and targeting health hazards is a robust health surveillance and DNBI monitoring
   and reporting system. The assigned medical team must develop a DNBI monitoring and
   reporting system that supports local as well as higher headquarters’ (AFFOR Surgeon)
   requirements. The team must educate all providers on the importance of accurate reporting
   and follow-up. This process is critical to health risk assessment and may produce the first
   indication of biological agent attack, particularly if no BW agent point detection systems are
   deployed.

       5.4.2.1. The assigned medical personnel, IDMT, SME, or Prevention and Aerospace
       Medicine (PAM) team immediately upon arrival establishes a medical
       surveillance/reporting function to support early recognition and reporting of infectious
       disease events, including BW agents, and DNBI incidence. A system available for this
       process is the Global Expeditionary Medical System (GEMS). (See Figure 5.1.) GEMS
       helps ensure medical surveillance, disease early warning, and reporting of medical
       information that may indicate covert BW agent attack to the wing commander, SRC, and
       theater surgeon.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   29



Figure 5.1. The Global Expeditionary Medical System

                       The Global Expeditionary Medical System (GEMS)

   GEMS is a suite of tools to provide Air Force-wide medical force protection through
   standardized medical surveillance, analysis, and C2. GEMS components include:

    -- A Patient Encounter Module (PEM) provides a standard electronic medical record for
       worldwide patient expeditionary surveillance and rearward connectivity.

    -- A Theater Epidemiology Module (TEM) aggregates field medical data, monitors
       deployed troops for BW/epidemic events, and provides theater medical C2 capability.

    -- Algorithms produce disease epidemiology reports as indicators of potential BW attack.
       Personnel may modify these algorithms to meet local requirements.

    -- A Theater Occupational Module (TOM) designed to monitor and track complex endemic
       and environmental concerns in the deployed setting.

    -- Force-wide, command-level, data analysis of deployed medical occurrences is archived
       at Brooks AFB, Texas.




      5.4.2.2. PAM team personnel should establish a surveillance plan to capture exposure
      data for occupational and environmental health hazards to deployed personnel using
      applicable reporting modules such as the Theater Occupational Model (TOM) module of
      GEMS. This mechanism can also be employed to track personnel NBC exposures. As in
      the occupational setting, most exposures will not result in a clinical outcome if personal
      protective and collective protective measures are employed or the exposure is at a level
      below that causing recognizable acute symptoms. This fact makes retrospective analysis
      of NBC attacks or other environmental exposures for long-term health effects difficult if
      not impossible as no record of exposure exists in the clinical encounter based medical
      record.

   5.4.3. Vulnerability Assessments and Surveillance Plans.

      5.4.3.1. Medical NBC Vulnerability Assessments. Deployed forces must have clean
      air and water, and safe food in order to carry out their assigned missions. Air, water, and
      food are highly vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional contamination from
      human activities, including contamination with NBC agents and toxic industrial
      chemicals/materials (TICs/TIMs).
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   30



        5.4.3.1.1. The vulnerability assessment begins with the site survey and continues
        throughout the deployment phase to redeployment. Careful documentation and
        resolution of vulnerabilities are critical to protecting the health of the deployed force
        and resolving postdeployment health concerns.

        5.4.3.1.2. The vulnerability assessment must address intentional and unintentional
        man-made, as well as natural, exposures. PAM teams conduct, maintain and
        continuously update the vulnerability assessment. Additionally, the PAM team
        conducts ongoing assessments of food, water, air, and other potential
        occupational/environmental exposures that could impact the health of the deployed
        population. With this information, a local commander can have an impact on the four
        phases of food and water systems—procurement sources, transportation/distribution
        systems, preparation, and storage.

        5.4.3.1.3. The DMC should conduct a risk-based assessment consisting of identifying
        potential threats and performing an ongoing analysis of vulnerabilities in the
        deployment area. A medical force health protection assessment fuses intelligence
        from human (HUMINT), signals (SIGINT), imagery (IMINT), and measurement and
        signature (MASINT) sources.            Counterintelligence, environmental, medical,
        information, and threat data, and additional information sources assist in developing a
        cohesive threat picture helpful to force protection decision makers.

     5.4.3.2. Food and Water Vulnerability. Commanders should assess the specific threat
     of conventional as well as intentional contamination to their food and water using
     available intelligence sources. This assessment should be a part of a focused analysis of
     the unit’s vulnerability and potential mitigation measures. The assessment should be
     conducted initially and the results reviewed as frequently as the unit’s mission and theater
     of operations dictate. The results of this assessment should be used to determine
     emergency food and water supplies needed by the installation.

        5.4.3.2.1. It is unreasonable to assume that current food and water protective
        measures in the deployment theater are adequate. Food and water safety, in addition
        to security, should be implemented jointly by Medical, Security Forces, Services,
        Civil Engineer, Transportation, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI),
        Intelligence, and Contracting personnel. The results from vulnerability assessments
        warrant critical review by local and theater leadership, prioritized planning for
        mitigation, and systematic implementation. This institutionalized process will best
        ensure improved safety and security of food supplies for consumption by Air Force
        personnel. (Attachment 3 contains Table A3.1, Threat Potential of BW Agents to
        Drinking Water and Table A3.2, Effects of Certain Agents on the Appearance of
        Food.) Refer to AFI 10-245 Air Force Antiterrorism(AT) Standards for additional
        guidance.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                 31




        5.4.3.2.2. Roles and responsibilities are:

           5.4.3.2.2.1. Installation Commander. The installation commander should direct
           the overall food and water safety and security program and appoint a food and
           water safety and security assessment team.

           5.4.3.2.2.2. Deployed Medical Commander. The DMC is responsible for the
           medical aspects of food and water protection throughout the chain of production
           or procurement and for establishing an ongoing food and water monitoring
           program during deployment. The DMC, or his/her representative, is a member of
           the installation food and water safety and security assessment team. The
           vulnerability of the food and water system to intentional contamination should
           also be considered when developing a food and water safety surveillance plan.
           The DMC appoints the public health officer (PHO) and Bioenvironmental
           Engineer (BEE), as a minimum to the assessment team. In the absence of a PHO
           or BEE, an IDMT or SME may be appointed. The DMC reports any suspected
           outbreaks of foodborne or waterborne contamination through Service and joint
           command and control structures. The DMC, through the PHO and BEE, is
           responsible for the inspections of stored food and water supplies to include
           inspection of food service facilities, prepared foods, and water. In addition, food
           and water supplies, including local water bottling facilities, should be inspected
           for signs of tampering and contamination.

           5.4.3.2.2.3. Contracting Officer. The contracting officer should incorporate
           safety and security measures in contracting instruments for food and water
           supplies. These measures are in addition to standard food and water safety
           requirements, directed in Air Force and DOD directives. The specific measures
           taken should be determined from assessment processes addressed in food and
           water force protection guidance documents.

           5.4.3.2.2.4. Transportation Commander. The transportation commander
           should ensure all transportation sources are aware of requirements for shipment,
           manifest, and container security.

           5.4.3.2.2.5. Security Forces Commander. The security forces commander
           should be responsible for ensuring the security of all shipments upon arrival at the
           installation and at a minimum, should inspect for intact seals and locks, should
           review manifests for accuracy, should review driver documentation for accuracy,
           should notify food service personnel of the arrival of food and water shipments,
           and should notify CE of the arrival of bulk potable and nonpotable water supplies.
           Physical security (a preventive measure) is the preferred mitigation option.

           5.4.3.2.2.6. Services Commander. The services commander should ensure
           adequate precautions such as controlling access to food facilities, employee
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                  32



            identification and background checks, physical security measures and ensuring
            employees are properly trained in all aspects of food security.

            5.4.3.2.2.7. Civil Engineer. In conjunction with the BEE, CE should ensure
            safety and security of bulk water supplies (e.g., wells, reservoirs, lakes, etc.) in
            addition to standard sanitation requirements.

            5.4.3.2.2.8. AFOSI and Intelligence. AFOSI and Intelligence resources should
            maintain the capability to determine and validate intentional contamination threats
            to installation food and water supplies.

            5.4.3.2.2.9. All Unit Commanders. All unit commanders should maintain the
            capability to ensure the safety and security of food and water supplies by being
            aware of the specific vulnerabilities in their locations, ensuring unit personnel
            inspect food and water supplies prior to consumption and report all suspect
            supplies.

        5.4.3.2.3. The principles of prevention, surveillance, control, and response for
        naturally occurring food/waterborne illnesses should also apply to some extent for
        mitigating the effects on intentional contamination. Deployed forces must have clean
        air, water, and safe food in order to carry out their assigned missions; and depending
        on the location of the installation, some food and water assets may be more critical
        than others. The DMC is referred to the Force Protection Battlelab, Commanders
        Guide to Food and Water Systems Force Protection for further guidance.

     5.4.3.3. Vector Surveillance. Deployed medical assets will conduct appropriate
     surveillance of vectors of medical importance to include insects, rodents, and animals
     capable of transmitting diseases in man. The first deployed asset possessing this
     capability is the PAM team. Refer to US Army FM 21-10, Field Hygiene and Sanitation,
     for additional guidance on disease vectors and personal protective measures.

  5.4.4. In-processing Deploying Service Members. The PAM team, the SME, or the
  deployed IDMT, accomplishes the following tasks:

     5.4.4.1. Ensures that all medical force health protection measures are accomplished.

     5.4.4.2. Reviews force health protection measures required for the area of responsibility
     (AOR) that were accomplished during the predeployment phase and corrects any
     deficiencies identified.

     5.4.4.3. Collects DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flow Sheet, or
     equivalent (deployed Medical Record) from all members.

     5.4.4.4. Provides an updated site-specific medical threat briefing and medical aspects of
     ATSO training.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                 33




  5.4.5. Field Sanitation and Hygiene. Strict adherence to field sanitation and hygiene
  measures minimize DNBI and spread of NBC agents or materials. US Army FM 21-10,
  Field Hygiene and Sanitation, provides specific guidance on this subject. This task will
  typically be accomplished by the PAM team but may also be accomplished by a SME or
  IDMT as required.

  5.4.6. Collective Protection: Collectively protected assets are prepositioned in NBC high-
  threat areas. The smallest collectively protected capability is the CP EMEDS Basic. The
  DMC may not have in-place or deployed CP and must plan accordingly for decontamination
  or alternate facilities if their non-CP DMFs are contaminated and become nonfunctional.
  The DMC must coordinate these requirements with the deployed AETF and document the
  requirements in the site Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP) or other deliberate
  plans.

  5.4.7. Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). All deployed medical personnel must be
  intimately familiar with MOPP levels and donning the Individual Protective Equipment
  (IPE). The deployed medical facility personnel will follow [deployed] wing procedures for
  donning and doffing IPE. The MOPP levels for the installation or sectors (if used) are
  determined by the senior Air Force commander and communicated to the base population
  and to each unit control center (UCC). The deployed medical facility area of responsibility
  may be designated as an individual sector when the senior Air Force commander delegates
  MOPP reduction authority to the DMC or SMO.

  5.4.8. Medical Sector NBC Detection and Contamination Control Plan. The base will
  most likely be divided into NBC sectors and the deployed medical facility will be responsible
  for NBC detection and contamination control within their sector (refer to AFMAN 10-2602
  [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and
  Standards). Normally, the medical sector is limited to the medical area of responsibility in
  the immediate area surrounding medical facility and facilities. In accordance with the Law
  of Armed Conflict, medical organizations may not be assigned responsibility for an area or
  sector that includes non-medical missions or capabilities or contains activities that are
  inconsistent with the non-combatant status of medical forces. Key to casualty prevention in
  an NBC environment is preventing the spread of post-attack NBC agents or materials.
  Essential components include detection, marking, communication, avoidance, and
  decontamination.

     5.4.8.1. The DMC will develop and employ a NBC Detection Plan at the direction of CE
     Readiness. The BEE NBC team or other preventive medicine assets will assist. In
     addition to the M8/M9 Paper capability that all base units possess, the medical unit may
     have more robust capabilities for detection to include vapor phase detection of CW
     agents, DOD sampling tickets for detection of BW agents, polymerase chain reaction
     (PCR) for identification of BW agents, and radiological measurement capability,
     depending on deployed UTC laydown.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                      34



       5.4.8.2. A biological agent attack may be covert or not detected by employed point
       detectors. The detection of BW agents requires healthcare provider awareness of clinical
       symptoms associated with various BW agents. In addition, a robust DNBI surveillance
       system performing real-time monitoring with seamless data reporting is necessary to
       detect a BW attack. Table A3.1 identifies possible biological agents threat potential to
       drinking water and the duration of impact.

       5.4.8.3. The CW Detection Plan must address reporting to the base NBC Defense Cell
       and marking of any known areas of contamination (refer to AFI 10-206, Operational
       Reporting). Detailed procedures for sector monitoring are found in AFMAN 32-4005,
       Personnel Protection and Attack Actions; and AFH 32-4014, Vol 4, USAF Ability to
       Survive and Operate Procedures in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC)
       Environment [will be replaced by AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological,
       Chemical, and Conventional Defense Operations and Standards].

5.5. Deployment Phase: Trans-attack Casualty Prevention Measures. The DMC is
responsible for the safety of medical personnel. Operations conducted will be consistent with the
procedures specified in AFH 32-4014, Vol 4, USAF Ability to Survive and Operate Procedures
in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Environment [will be replaced by AFMAN 10-
2502 [Draft], WMD Threat Planning and Response Handbook]. Casualties can be minimized
through proper education of personnel on local alarm conditions, donning the IPE, understanding
MOPP levels, operation of CP systems, and adherence to ATSO principles for an NBC
environment. The deployed medical assets cannot provide passive defense and treat NBC
casualties if they themselves fall victim to an NBC attack.

5.6. Deployment Phase: Post-attack Casualty Prevention Measures.

   5.6.1. The DMC is responsible for NBC surveillance for health risk assessment and
   treatment. This surveillance quantifies NBC exposure data to determine personnel’s short-
   and long-term health risk in executing the mission in contaminated environments. It also
   includes identification of NBC agents or materials, either through clinical samples and
   diagnosis, or environmental sampling. The DMC is also responsible for detection of NBC
   agents or materials within the medical sector (only) and in the base drinking water and food
   supplies. Detection provides the general information necessary to facilitate operations while
   identification provides the specific information necessary for a tailored medical response and
   health surveillance.

   5.6.2. Detection generally refers to determining the presence of a class of agents (G-series
   nerve agents, for example) and its relative abundance. This also applies in biological agent
   detection where hand-held bioassays employed may not have the sensitivity to reliably detect
   and identify BW agents.

   5.6.3. Identification refers to determining the specific NBC agent employed. Identification
   in the form of clinical diagnoses may be the first indication of a covert attack using biological
   agents. This distinction becomes important in the response to biological agent incidents
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                 35



  since presentation in the clinical setting and diagnostics may occur after a prolonged
  incubation period following release. Rapid recognition and identification using deployed
  health surveillance and advanced NBC agent analytical tools—such as the GEMS and
  polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based pathogen identification—vastly improves medical
  and commander situational awareness to NBC attacks.

  5.6.4. Contamination Avoidance.

     5.6.4.1. Medical Sector Detection, Marking, and Reporting. When directed by the
     SRC, the deployed medical unit immediately after the attack will conduct sector
     reconnaissance for NBC hazards as well as conventional munitions damage, and report
     this information to the SRC by means of the medical control center (MCC). Refer to
     AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC)
     Defense Operations and Standards for post attack reconnaissance, marking, and reporting
     procedures. Initial medical NBC detection capability is limited to chemical agent
     detection in the form of M8 and M9 Paper that is contained in the individual’s C-bag.
     Upon arrival of the PAM team, the chemical detection capability is augmented with
     M256A1 and M272 detection kits (vapor and water). This capability will be
     supplemented with the arrival of the BNBC (to be superseded by medical NBC [MNBC])
     team that possesses more advanced chemical detection (chemical agent monitoring
     system [CAMS]), biological agent detection (hand-held bioassays), and radiological
     measurement (ADM300). The medical unit will report the results of this survey as soon
     as possible to the SRC.

     5.6.4.2. Basewide Surveillance. As soon as operationally feasible, the DMC will
     resume health surveillance and reporting activities of food, water, NBC exposures,
     vectors, environmental, and DNBIs using applicable reporting modules such as GEMS.

     5.6.4.3. Basewide Agent Identification. Once an NBC event has occurred, the DMC
     should continue to execute detection and ensure rapid identification for medical treatment
     and recording of personnel exposures. Environmental samples of contaminated media
     are collected by the BNBC team and transported for analysis.

         5.6.4.3.1. Identification of the specific agent may require several instruments and
         further analysis. For biological pathogens, deployed BAT teams can conduct
         expedient presumptive agent identification. There are additional capabilities within
         specific theaters of operations. For example, the biological warfare defense
         laboratory (BWDL) at Osan AB provides capability designed for and specific to the
         operation of the PORTAL SHIELD biological warfare detection system. Sister
         Service laboratories deployed to the theater (e.g., the 520th Theater Army Medical
         Laboratory [TAML]) may be used to provide additional quantitative analyses.
         Definitive identification of biological warfare agents is accomplished at USAMRIID.

         5.6.4.3.2. Definitive identification of specific chemical and radiological agents and
         contamination levels—particularly low-levels—must be accomplished using
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                  36



         theaterwide assets or reach-back laboratories, to include the capabilities of the other
         Services. These capabilities exist within the Air Force Radiation Assessment Team
         (AFRAT) for radiological contaminants (FFRA 1/2/3). Other assets that may be
         available in the theater of operations include the 520th TAML, the Navy Forward
         Deployed Laboratory (NFDL), Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine Unit
         (NEPMU) assets, or labs in the continental United States (CONUS).

  5.6.5 Protection.

     5.6.5.1. The DMC provides technical medical information and advice to the SRC
     including information on physiological and psychological effects of contamination. The
     DMC advises the commander on the administration and use of chemical or biological
     agent pretreatment drugs, prophylaxis medications, and antidotes. The DMC advises
     mortuary affairs on concerns regarding handling and disposition of contaminated
     remains.

     5.6.5.2.    Enforcing sanitation, hygiene, and infection control is a leadership
     responsibility. Following a biological agent attack, the DMC should stress the importance
     of good infection control practices within the DMF and base-wide line commanders
     should stress the importance of field sanitation and hygiene measures to minimize cross
     contamination. Washing with soap and water is the most effective and simplest measure
     for controlling communicable disease. Of the potential BW agents, only plague and
     smallpox are readily spread person-to-person by aerosol and require more than standard
     infection control precautions (gown, mask with eye shield, gloves).

  5.6.6. Contamination Control.

     5.6.6.1. The DMC is responsible for medical decontamination of patients and deployed
     medical facility resources within the medical sector. Upon arrival, the Wartime Medical
     Decontamination Team (WMDT) provides this capability. In the absence of the WMDT,
     the DMC may organize and train an ad hoc team of available personnel if medical patient
     decontamination is tactically necessary, using line and/or medical personnel and materiel.
     (Refer to AFMS CONOPS for WMDT decontamination procedures.)

     5.6.6.2. Movement between sectors is controlled by the base sectoring plan. The
     deployed medical facility is responsible for contamination control within its sector. DMF
     personnel contaminated pursuant to their duties will process through the medical
     facility’s ambulatory decontamination line.

     5.6.6.3. PAM/BEE NBC teams will advise the SRC on appropriate decontamination and
     treatment techniques for food and water contaminated with NBC agents or materials.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                 37




5.7. Post Deployment Actions.

   5.7.1. The DMC needs to continue the ongoing health surveillance program. Performing
   postdeployment health assessments (DD Form 2796) ensures exposures are documented;
   ensures follow up of exposures and treatment; and ensures the deployed medical record
   returns with the individual. Documentation of NBC exposures, medical interventions, and
   use of prophylaxis and antidotes in the individual’s deployed medical record is critical.

   5.7.2. The provider (IDMT, SME, or PAM team member) administers this assessment to all
   redeploying personnel within 5 days of redeployment.

   5.7.3. Up-channel surveillance data to the DOD central data repository as specified in Joint
   Policy Memorandum on Deployed Occupational Health and Environmental Health
   Surveillance.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                        38

                         CASUALTY CARE AND MANAGEMENT

6.1. Overview. This chapter gives a general overview of procedures and references for NBC
casualty management, combat stress management in NBC environments, patient
decontamination, patient movement, and patient evacuation. (A description of medical
capability available at each level of care can be found in AFTTP 3-42.7, Aerospace Medical
Contingency Ground Support System.)

6.2. Casualty Care and Management in NBC Environments. The deployed medical facility
should be able to provide, or arrange for the provision of, the following patient care services in
an NBC threat environment: (Refer to AFMS CONOPS, Wartime Medical Decontamination
Team.)

   6.2.1. Protect medical personnel and patients against exposure to or contamination by NBC
   agents or materials.

   6.2.2. Provide basic life- and limb-saving care to casualties while in an NBC-contaminated
   environment, prior to and during the decontamination process.

   6.2.3. Decontaminate arriving casualties and medical staff.

   6.2.4. Treat casualties from initial resuscitation through definitive care or evacuation.

   6.2.5. Evacuate (intratheater/intertheater) decontaminated casualties suffering the effects of
   radiological, biological, or chemical agents, provide appropriate care en route, and prevent
   spread of contamination during the evacuation process.

   6.2.6. Track and follow-up medical care of personnel exposed to NBC contamination.

   6.2.7. Provide prophylactic measures, such as immunizations and medications, to all
   supported personnel in the threat area.

   6.2.8. Conduct medical surveillance to determine if a biological agent is in use in the area.

   6.2.9. Initiate treatment of nuclear event casualties, including treatment of blast injury, burn
   injury, and injury from ionizing radiation.

   6.2.10. Initiate treatment of internally contaminated radiological casualties within 6 hours of
   arrival at a Level 3 or higher medical facility.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     39




6.3. Triage of Suspected Contaminated Casualties (Mixed Casualties).

   6.3.1. The purpose of triage is to mitigate the effects of an NBC event and to effectively
   allocate medical resources. Triage will be based on conventional injuries and NBC exposure
   (agent type, physical state, route of exposure, and severity of exposure). Triage occurs at
   three specific points in time—decontamination, treatment, and evacuation. However, it is an
   on-going process that requires continuous reevaluation of the patient throughout treatment
   and evacuation. Patients who appear stable may later deteriorate. Patients with life- or limb-
   threatening conditions will receive immediate emergency medical treatment before
   decontamination. (Refer to JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological
   and Chemical [NBC] Environments.)

   6.3.2. A discussion of triage categories and first aid for chemical, nuclear, and biological
   agents can be found in US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense
   (USAMRICD), Medical Management of Chemical Casualties Handbook, Armed Forces
   Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), Medical Management of Radiological Casualties,
   and USAMRIID, Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook. A general
   discussion of triage categories is included in attachment 4.

6.4. Medical Decontamination.

   6.4.1. The purpose of decontamination is to remove external contamination to prevent
   further injury to the patient, or contamination of medical personnel, other patients, or medical
   assets. Medical treatment of casualties is difficult in protective equipment. Definitive
   medical care will require the patient to first be decontaminated and to receive treatment in a
   collectively protected or uncontaminated facility.           For detailed decontamination
   procedures, refer to the AFMS CONOPS, Wartime Medical Decontamination Team, or US
   Army FM 8-10-7, Health Service Support in NBC Environments.

   6.4.2. Decontamination starts with self-aid and buddy care. Priority in decontamination
   should be given to physical removal of the agent as rapidly as possible. This is accomplished
   by first removing the patient from further exposure to the agent, then removal of the agent
   from the patient. Spot decontamination should be immediately applied to areas of liquid
   contamination. This should be followed by thorough decontamination as soon as possible.
   Although skin decontamination is not generally necessary after exposure to vapor alone,
   clothing should be removed because it may contain trapped vapor. The skin should be
   thoroughly cleaned using soap and water or other approved skin decontamination solutions,
   following clothing removal.

   6.4.3. Medical units must be prepared to accept contaminated casualties. Ideally, casualties
   should be decontaminated to the greatest extent possible in the field during the SABC
   process. However, some individuals may arrive at the deployed medical facility that have
   not been decontaminated, are still partially contaminated, or that have become contaminated
   en route. These individuals must be decontaminated before they are admitted to prevent
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                  40



  further injury to the patient and prevent contamination of medical personnel, other patients,
  or the DMF.

  6.4.4. The deployed medical facility will provide emergency life- and limb-saving medical
  treatment to casualties prior to and during the decontamination process. Care provided to
  contaminated casualties may include airway management, assisted ventilation, control of
  hemorrhage and shock, and medication administration. Available medical resources will
  determine the scope of care provided to casualties awaiting decontamination. As a
  minimum, Basic Life Support will be provided. Deployed medical commanders are
  responsible for allocating treatment resources to support medical management of
  contaminated, as well as uncontaminated and decontaminated casualties.

  6.4.5. At the deployed medical facility entry control point, arriving casualties will be
  monitored for contamination. Contaminated casualties will be sent to a medical
  decontamination area where they will be triaged, treated for life- and limb-threatening
  conditions, and decontaminated as soon as possible. Non-contaminated casualties will be
  sent directly to the treatment area. (See Figure 6.1.) All patients arriving at the treatment
  location (decontaminated and originally uncontaminated) will be re-triaged prior to entry into
  the definitive care area. (See paragraph 6.3, “Triage of Suspected Contaminated Casualties
  (Mixed Casualties).”) Ambulatory personnel with no significant symptoms should process
  through standard Contamination Control Areas whenever practical for decontamination.

   6.4.6. Ideally, the Wartime Medical Decontamination Team (WMDT) UTC FFGLA/FFGLB
   will be provided. Bedded deployed medical facilities (fixed sites, EMEDS + 10 and larger
   deployable assemblages), should be assigned WMDT assets in high NBC threat
   environments. Smaller medical units such as air transportable clinics, IDMT clinics, and
   small portable expeditionary aeromedical rapid response (SPEARR) teams will generally not
   have WMDT teams collocated. EMEDS Basic units may or may not have an assigned
   WMDT. If a dedicated medical decontamination team is not available, augmentation
   personnel will be identified and trained. Preplanning for this scenario is vital. The senior
   medical officer must work through the line commander to obtain sufficient personnel and
   decontamination materiel of opportunity.

6.5. Patient Treatment.

   6.5.1. Chemical Event. Basic principles of emergency medical care are the same for all
   chemical agents—airway, breathing, circulation, drugs (appropriate therapeutic intervention),
   and decontamination (ABCDD). Supportive therapy must also be provided. Refer to
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   42



  AFJMAN 44-149, Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military
  Chemical Injuries; USAMRICD, Medical Management of Chemical Casualties Handbook;
  and the Textbook of Military Medicine for specific procedures for treatment and management
  of chemical agent casualties.

     6.5.1.1. Nerve Agents. Three drugs are used to treat nerve agent exposure—atropine,
     pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl.), and diazepam. The Mark I autoinjector includes a 2
     mg atropine injector and 600 mg of 2-PAM Cl in a second injector. Individuals with
     mild symptoms of nerve agent exposure should receive one Mark I injector. One to two
     additional doses should be given at 5-minute intervals if symptoms persist. Patients with
     severe symptoms (involvement of two or more organ systems) should receive 3
     autoinjectors immediately, followed by diazepam injection. Medical personnel may need
     to administer additional atropine and diazepam. Pyridostigmine bromide (P-tabs) may be
     used as a pretreatment prior to nerve agent exposure. It is not an antidote. Issue or use of
     P-tabs requires approval at the Secretary of Defense level. Mark I antidote kit treatment
     will still be required following actual nerve agent exposure.

     6.5.1.2. Vesicants (Blister Agents). Treatment for vesicant exposure is symptomatic,
     based on site of injury. Vesicants predominantly affect the skin, eyes, and respiratory
     tract. Severe vesicant exposure can also affect the gastrointestinal and immune systems.
     Treatment of skin and eye injuries is similar to that for other thermal or chemical burns,
     except less aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid replacement is typically needed. Symptoms
     may be delayed following exposure to vesicants. Respiratory distress may occur in
     otherwise healthy individuals several hours following exposure.

     6.5.1.3. Cyanides (Blood Agents). Cyanides inhibit cellular utilization of oxygen. Mild
     exposures may be treated with oxygen and supportive therapy. Exposure to cyanides
     agents may result in immediate death. Severe exposure will likely require mechanical
     ventilation, oxygenation, circulatory support, correction of metabolic acidosis, and
     seizure control as well as specific antidotal therapy. Antidotal therapy is provided in a
     two-step process. First, a methemoglobin forming agent such as inhaled amyl nitrite or
     intravenous sodium nitrite should be administered. This is followed by sodium
     thiosulfate administered intravenously.          Methemoglobin forming agents are
     contraindicated in smoke inhalation patients with high carboxyhemoglobin levels. These
     patients should be treated with sodium thiosulfate and oxygen alone.

     6.5.1.4. Pulmonary, Incapacitating, and Riot-control Agents. Treatment is specified
     in AFJMAN 44-149, Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military
     Chemical Injuries; USAMRICD, Medical Management of Chemical Casualties
     Handbook; and the Textbook of Military Medicine.

  6.5.2. Biological Event. Key treatment issues are addressed below for different types of
  biological casualties. Detailed treatment information for biological casualties is found in
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     43



  AFMAN (I) 44-156, Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent Casualties and USAMRIID,
  Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook.

     6.5.2.1. Anthrax. Anthrax is a known potential biological weapon. The causative agent
     is Bacillus anthracis. Exposure can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or skin
     absorption. An FDA-licensed vaccine is available. Personnel should be vaccinated IAW
     current Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program (AVIP) guidelines. Ciprofloxacin and
     doxycycline antibiotics can be used for exposure or prophylaxis. Anthrax is not
     contagious and isolation is not necessary.

     6.5.2.2. Plague. Plague can be transmitted by infected fleas (bubonic) or person-to-
     person (pneumonic) through respiratory droplets. The causative agent is Yersenia pestis.
     Pneumonic plague is a highly contagious disease and droplet precautions are necessary.
     Effective field sanitation and preventive medicine measures are required to minimize
     bubonic plague transmission. As a general practice, plague patients should be transported
     only with other plague patients during aeromedical evacuation. Plague prophylaxis is
     accomplished with doxycycline (preferred) and ciprofloxacin (may also be effective).
     Early administration of antibiotics and supportive therapy is very effective. However,
     pneumonic plague is 95% fatal if the disease is not treated within 48 hours of symptom
     onset. Streptomycin is the drug of choice for treatment. Gentamicin, cyprofloxacin, and
     doxycycline are also effective. There is no licensed vaccine for pneumonic plague.

     6.5.2.3. Tularemia. Tularemia (also known as rabbit fever and deer fly fever) is a
     zoonotic disease. Humans typically acquire infection through contact of their skin or
     mucous membranes with tissues or body fluids of infected animals, or from bites of
     infected deerflies, mosquitoes, or ticks. Francisella tularensis can remain viable weeks
     in water, soil, carcasses, and hides. It is resistant to sub-freezing temperatures for several
     months. It is easily killed by heat and disinfectants. The primary threat is by aerosol
     release. Contamination of food or water supply is also possible.

        6.5.2.3.1. Preexposure prophylaxis is provided by a live attenuated vaccine
        available as an IND. Postexposure prophylaxis, following a BW attack includes
        doxycycline, tetracycline, or ciprofloxacin.

        6.5.2.3.2. Supportive care may include respiratory support and hydration. Open
        lesions should be covered and topical antibiotics applied. Tularemia may be treated
        with streptomycin, gentamicin, or ciprofloxacin. Fatality rate for inhalation tularensis
        is unknown.

        6.5.2.3.3. Control of infection is through the application of standard precautions.
        Tularemia is not communicable person to person. Patients may be evacuated
        observing Standard Precautions during evacuation.

     6.5.2.4. Q-Fever. The endemic form of Q-fever is a zoonotic disease caused by a
     rickettsia, Coxiella burnetii. Natural reservoirs are sheep, cattle, and goats. The
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                44



     organisms grow to especially high concentrations in placental tissues. Exposure to
     infected animals at parturition is an important risk factor for endemic disease. The
     organisms are also excreted in animal milk, urine, and feces. Humans acquire the disease
     by inhalation of aerosols contaminated with the organisms. Heavy environmental
     contamination with C. burnetii could pose a long-term risk due to environmental
     persistence. Dusts generated from the contaminated environment may continue to
     transmit the disease.

        6.5.2.4.1. Preexposure Prophylaxis. A formalin-inactivated whole cell vaccine is
        available as an IND for immunization of at-risk personnel.

        6.5.2.4.2. Postexposure Prophylaxis. Postexposure prophylaxis is accomplished
        with tetracycline or doxycycline. Antibiotics given prophylactically after exposure
        may delay but not prevent the onset of symptoms.

        6.5.2.4.3. Medical Management. Medical management is with doxycycline or
        tetracycline. Treat patients who are unable to take tetracycline with ciprofloxacin or
        other quinolones.

        6.5.2.4.4. Infection Control. Q-fever is not communicable person to person.
        Patients exposed to Q-fever by aerosol do not present a risk for secondary
        contamination or re-aerosolization of the organism. Observe standard precautions
        when handling patients.

        6.5.2.4.5.   Decontamination.  Exposed clothing and equipment should be
        decontaminated. Decontamination is accomplished with soap and water, 5%
        microchem plus (quaternary ammonium compound), 70% ethyl alcohol, or 0.5%
        hypochlorite solution.

        6.5.2.4.6. Aeromedical Evacuation. Patients may be evacuated with other classes
        of patients.

     6.5.2.5. Smallpox. Variola virus causes smallpox. It is a member of the Orthopox virus
     family and is very contagious to humans. Despite the global eradication of smallpox and
     continued availability of a vaccine, the potential weaponization of Variola continues to
     pose a military threat. Humans are the only natural reservoir of Variola. Transmission
     usually occurs by respiratory droplet, following close face-to-face contact. Smallpox is
     also transmitted by direct contact with skin lesions or drainage, or with contaminated
     objects.

        6.5.2.5.1. Preexposure Prophylaxis. US forces are no longer routinely immunized.
        When the threat indicates, senior leadership may direct vaccination of personnel,
        pending vaccine availability.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                 45



        6.5.2.5.2. Postexposure Prophylaxis. All individuals exposed to or suspected of
        being exposed to smallpox BW agents should have active immunization. Contacts
        should be vaccinated, or receive booster vaccinations as soon as possible, optimally
        within 24 hours.

        6.5.2.5.3. Medical Management. Provide supportive care since there is no specific
        antiviral therapy available for smallpox.

        6.5.2.5.4. Infection Control. Strict (standard, contact, and airborne) isolation and
        quarantine of all patients must be maintained until scabs have separated.

        6.5.2.5.5. Aeromedical Evacuation. Smallpox is an internationally quarantinable
        disease (IQD). Apply strict quarantine measures. Isolate and evacuate all smallpox
        patients with other smallpox patients only. Evacuation of smallpox patients across
        national boundaries requires close coordination between the supported and supporting
        combatant commanders and the Department of State. See paragraph 6.5.5,
        “Quarantine and Isolation.”

     6.5.2.6. Toxins.

        6.5.2.6.1. Clostridium botulinum Toxin. Botulinum toxins are a group of proteins
        produced by the bacillus Clostridium botulinum. There are seven distinct but related
        neurotoxins, A through G, produced by different strains of the clostridial bacillus.
        All seven types act by similar mechanisms. The toxins produce similar effects when
        inhaled or ingested. The time course may vary depending on the route of exposure
        and the dose received. Covert contamination of water supplies by botulism toxin
        should be addressed. Although an aerosol attack is by far the most likely scenario,
        enemy special forces or terrorists might use this agent to produce foodborne botulism
        in those so targeted. The reservoir is soil, animals, and fish. High-risk foods are
        primarily improperly canned foods and dried meat or fish. Transmission is via the
        consumption of food contaminated with the C. botulinum toxin.

            6.5.2.6.1.1. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. A pentavalent toxoid of Clostridium
            botulinum toxin types A, B, C, D, and E is available under an IND status.

            6.5.2.6.1.2. Postexposure Prophylaxis. Currently, postexposure prophylaxis is
            not available. Animal experiments demonstrate that botulinum antitoxin is
            effective; however, human data or practice guidelines are not available.
            Botulinum antitoxin should be considered in extraordinary circumstances.

            6.5.2.6.1.3. Medical Management. Supportive care includes respiratory
            support, hydration, bowel, bladder and skin care, nasogastric suctioning for ileus,
            physical therapy, and psychological support.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                46



            6.5.2.6.1.4. Antitoxin. Administration of antitoxin is reasonable if disease has
            not progressed to a stable state. A trivalent equine antitoxin has been available
            from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for cases of foodborne
            botulism.

            6.5.2.6.1.5. Contamination Control and Aeromedical Evacuation. Botulism
            is not communicable person to person. Patients may be evacuated with other
            classes of patients. Observe standard precautions for evacuation.

  6.5.3. Radiation Exposure Event.

     6.5.3.1.    Patients who are contaminated with radiological material should be
     decontaminated by removal of surface contaminants. This should be accomplished by
     clothing removal and skin washing with soap and water. As with biological and chemical
     agents, do not delay emergency medical treatment for radiologically contaminated
     casualties. Once decontaminated, a patient is not “radioactive.” However, patients
     suffering from radiological exposure may require reverse/barrier isolation due to bone
     marrow suppression and a compromised immune system. As a minimum, this should
     include gloves, masks, and strict hand washing at all levels of care. Systemic exposure
     may affect the bone marrow, gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular system, skin, and the
     central nervous system. Radiation injuries, including systemic exposures, will require
     supportive care at all levels of care. Once patients are decontaminated externally, the
     potential for cross-contamination to uncontaminated areas and personnel is minimal.
     Supportive care includes airway management, fluid administration with volume
     expanders, antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications, and aggressive therapeutic treatment
     when signs and symptoms of infection appear.

     6.5.3.2. Internal contamination may occur from inhalation, ingestion, or absorption.
     Intact skin is a barrier to alpha particles; however internal contamination can occur
     through abrasions and punctures in the skin. Organs affected by internal contamination
     include the lungs, liver, thyroid, and bones. Blocking or diluting agents, and chelation
     therapy, may reduce total exposure to radioactive materials in the body.

     6.5.3.3. Detailed treatment information for radiological casualties is found in AFMAN(I)
     44-161, Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties and Armed Forces Radiology
     Research Institute (AFRRI), Medical Management of Radiological Casualties. For
     patients with internal contamination, low-levels of radioactive material may be excreted
     in the urine, feces, sweat, and other body fluids.

  6.5.4. Mental Health Service Support.

     6.5.4.1. NBC events will generate stress, fear, panic, and uncertainty. US forces have
     little real world operational experience in NBC environments, and fear of the unknown
     will cause both acute stress and delayed stress reactions among personnel in all ranks.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                47



     The senior medical officer must provide the installation commander consultation on
     mental health issues and stress management.

     6.5.4.2. Stress will manifest itself in different ways at different times during the NBC
     event. In the pre-attack phase, fear of the unknown and uncertainty of the adequacy of
     defensive equipment and emergency plans may produce excessive stress. During an
     NBC event, the psychological effects of death, suffering, and destruction; the
     physiological and psychological effect of wearing protective equipment; and being
     isolated and not knowing what is happening, will be the greatest stressors. After an NBC
     event, debilitating injury for wounded personnel, “survivor guilt,” and fear of long-term
     health consequences (particularly reproductive) are mental health concerns.

     6.5.4.3. The following techniques are recommended to minimize these stressors and their
     negative impact on mental health.

        6.5.4.3.1. Keep people informed as much as security concerns will permit.

        6.5.4.3.2. Train aggressively and exercise response plans. Improve these as needed.

        6.5.4.3.3. Encourage open discussion about possible health affects and related
        concerns at all levels of supervision and command. Provide fact-based risk
        assessments to unit leadership that neither diminish nor exaggerate the threat.

        6.5.4.3.4. Take steps to ensure all personnel are assigned clear roles and
        responsibilities in response to an NBC event. Hold personnel accountable for
        understanding and performing their jobs.

        6.5.4.3.5. Encourage open and realistic, but respectful and appropriate, discussion of
        stress and fear. Emphasize to personnel that they can succeed in their jobs despite
        their fear.

        6.5.4.3.6. Rapidly intervene at the lowest command level possible for individuals
        displaying signs and symptoms of acute or delayed stress reactions. Recognize that
        stress is a normal reaction. Recommend treatments that emphasize reassurance,
        temporary rest and removal, and return to duty (RTD) as soon as medically advisable.

        6.5.4.3.7. Establish guidelines for medication and evacuation of stress casualties in
        severe cases.

        6.5.4.3.8. Coordinate with Life Skills Support Center and Chaplain Services for
        counseling and mental health support at the installation.

        6.5.4.3.9. Determine location and establish plans for accessing mental health care
        providers if not available at the deployed medical facility.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   48




  6.5.5. Quarantine and Isolation.

     6.5.5.1. Quarantine Considerations. BW agents may display a wide range of times
     between exposure and the onset of clinical symptoms (botulinum toxin, 12 to 36 hours;
     and smallpox, 7 to 17 days). Multiple agents can lead to the presence of coinfection-
     acute illness with short incubation and longer incubating agent such as smallpox (which
     may declare itself after patients have been evacuated for evaluation or treatment of the
     short incubating disease). Therefore, consideration should be given to quarantining
     patients for 17 days after AE from a BW area if plague, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic
     fevers cannot be excluded.          Administrative quarantine of the entire military
     installation/facility may be required in the event of a large disease outbreak, BW, or
     terrorist event.

     6.5.5.2. Isolation Considerations. Isolation should be in designated tents or other
     structures. The use of surgical masks on patients is appropriate when separate tents or
     structures are not available. Infection control practices can be modified after the agent is
     identified. Most agents require only standard precautions.

     6.5.5.3. References. Refer to AFMAN(I) 44-156, Treatment of Biological Warfare
     Agent Casualties, and USAMRIID, Medical Management of Biological Casualties
     Handbook, for additional information. Contact the AFFOR/SG for current quarantine
     and isolation guidance and policy.

     6.5.5.4. Mass Casualty Situations. Infection control procedures should be reinforced
     for mass casualty situations with undifferentiated febrile illness following a suspected
     BW attack. Isolate patients and use respiratory droplet precautions, in addition to
     standard precautions, until contagious disease can be excluded. Field conditions may
     dictate actual isolation practices. The precautions listed below should be complied
     with to the fullest extent possible.

     6.5.5.5. Respiratory Protection. Base personnel use the NBC mask for protection from
     biological agents. When biological agent contamination is limited to a quarantine or
     isolation area within the DMF, alternative respiratory protection may be appropriate.
     Bioenvironmental Engineering personnel, in consultation with infection control
     personnel, should determine alternative respiratory protection requirements. The
     following should be considered when determining respiratory protection:

        6.5.5.5.1. The degree to which the agent is infectious (i.e., Will it spread person to
        person?).

        6.5.5.5.2. The degree to which aerosolization of the agent is possible: If spread by
        respiratory droplets (e.g., Plague), they are heavy and are believed to not travel more
        than 3 feet from the patient, versus droplet nuclei (Smallpox, TB) which are small and
        can travel on air currents for long distances.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                      49




        6.5.5.5.3. Prognosis if exposed to agent.

        6.5.5.5.4. Existing ventilation and infection control procedures.

        6.5.5.5.5. Respiratory protection alternatives may include the use of air purifying
        respirators with N, P, or R-series filters at 95, 99, or 100% efficiency.

     6.5.5.6. Standard Precautions.

        6.5.5.6.1. Wash hands after patient contact.

        6.5.5.6.2. Use gloves when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and
        contaminated items.

        6.5.5.6.3. Use respiratory protection. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and
        atmosphere supplying respirators may also be used when filtering face piece devices
        and other air purifying respirators will not provide adequate protection during
        procedures likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or
        excretions.

        6.5.5.6.4. Use eye protection and wear a gown during procedures likely to generate
        splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions.

        6.5.5.6.5. Handle contaminated patient-care equipment and linen in a manner that
        prevents the transfer of microorganisms to people or equipment.

        6.5.5.6.6. Practice care when handling sharps.

        6.5.5.6.7. Use a mask or other ventilation device as an alternative to mouth-to-mouth
        resuscitation when practical.

        6.5.5.6.8. Ideally, place the patient in a private room when feasible if they may have
        a contagious illness. Use cohort isolation of patients with similar infection if unable
        to isolate individual patients.

     6.5.5.7. Specific Precautions. Include standard precautions plus:

        6.5.5.7.1. Airborne Precautions. This isolation strategy must be thought through
        based on the physical nature of the structure from which care is provided, i.e.,
        hospital versus tent.

            6.5.5.7.1.1. Hospital. Place the patient in a private room that has negative air
            pressure, at least six air changes per hour, and appropriate air filtration before it is
            discharged from the room.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                 50




           6.5.5.7.1.2. Hospital. Use respiratory protection when entering the room; i.e., N-
           95 particulate respirator.

           6.5.5.7.1.3. Hospital. Limit movement and transport of the patient. Use a mask
           on the patient if they need to be moved.

           6.5.5.7.1.4. Tent. This isolation will pose one of the greatest challenges as it
           requires a special negative pressure ventilation, which a tent does not have.
           Therefore, considerations will include the following:

           6.5.5.7.1.5. Tent. First, put a mask on the patient immediately. If available, use
           the N-95 particulate respirator. If it is not available, use the cup style surgical
           mask as a second choice. If that is not available, use the tie style surgical mask
           with the goal being to ensure a very close fit around the edges so respiratory
           particles do not escape. If the patient cannot tolerate a mask then try to avoid
           having them enter the tent, have all healthcare workers in a mask and begin to
           consider options.

           6.5.5.7.1.6. Tent. Evaluate the patient as soon as possible. If they have to be
           admitted and the Infectious Disease Team component is not present then consider
           setting up an alternate shelter outside (downwind) if the weather permits, OR,
           placing the patient as far as possible from all other patients AND keeping the
           patient masked at all times. The mask will have to be changed approximately
           every two hours, as the moisture from exhalation will decrease its ability to act as
           an effective barrier. If the Infectious Disease Team component is present they
           will have the capability to set up a tent specifically for the care of patients
           requiring airborne precautions.

           6.5.5.7.1.7. Tent. Another intervention can be the use of a curtain to create a
           “cubical” for this type of patient. They will still have to wear the mask but it may
           offer some additional protection to others in the tent.

           6.5.5.7.1.8. Tent. Teach the patient to use a facial tissue to cover their mouth
           and nose if they need to remove the mask for coughing or clearing secretions.
           Provide them a trash bag in which to place their facial tissue.

           6.5.5.7.1.9. Tent. Healthcare workers will wear a mask when providing
           immediate care to this type of patient. For healthcare workers, the mask is worn
           once for a patient encounter and then discarded into the regular trash. Attempts to
           try and save or reuse these masks are usually unsuccessful due to limited space
           and the potential to cross contaminate each other’s mask.

           6.5.5.7.1.10. Tent. Other protective apparel to include gloves and gowns are
           worn as appropriate for the task being performed.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   51




           6.5.5.7.1.11. Tent. Transporting the patient within the tent area requires the
           patient wear the N-95 respirator mask, properly fitted to cover the nose and
           mouth.

        6.5.5.7.2. Droplet Precautions.

           6.5.5.7.2.1. Hospital. Place the patient in a private room or with someone with
           the same infection. If not feasible, maintain at least 3 feet between patients.

           6.5.5.7.2.2. Hospital. Use respiratory protection within 3 feet of the patient. A
           surgical mask that is well fitted to the face, such that it is not gapped open on the
           sides, is adequate.

           6.5.5.7.2.3. Hospital. Limit movement and transport of the patient. Use a well
           fitting mask on the patient if they need to be moved.

           6.5.5.7.2.4. Tent. The easiest way to prevent the spread of these droplets is to
           place a surgical mask on the patient. If available, use the cup-style as it fits more
           closely to the face.

           6.5.5.7.2.5. Tent. Patient condition and weather permitting, the patient may also
           be evaluated outside the tent, downwind preferably. If they require entry in the
           tent or need to be admitted, the mask is required for the patient. If admitted they
           should be placed as far as possible from other patients, at the far end of the tent.

           6.5.5.7.2.6. Tent. It is recommended that a tent curtain/divider be used to create
           a “cubical” for the patient. As long as they are enclosed in the cubical they will
           not have to wear a mask because the respiratory droplets are large and will not
           travel far (3 feet is the general rule). If this type of cubical cannot be created, it
           would be wise to keep a mask on the patient until such time as they are no longer
           infectious.

           6.5.5.7.2.7. Tent. Healthcare workers providing immediate care to the patient
           will wear a cup-style surgical mask.

           6.5.5.7.2.8. Tent. Other protective apparel to include gloves and gowns are worn
           appropriate for the task being performed.

           6.5.5.7.2.9. Tent. Transporting the patient within the tent area requires the
           patient wear a cup style surgical mask as a minimum.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                52




        6.5.5.7.3. Contact Precautions.

           6.5.5.7.3.1. General. In addition to standard precautions use contact precautions
           for patients known to or suspected to have serious illnesses easily transmitted by
           direct patient contact or by indirect contact with items in the patient’s
           environment. The patient is restricted to the room during isolation.

           6.5.5.7.3.2. Hospital. Place the patient in a private room or with someone with
           the same infection if possible.

           6.5.5.7.3.3. Hospital. Use gloves when entering the room. Change gloves after
           contact with infective material.

           6.5.5.7.3.4. Hospital. Wear a gown when entering the room if contact with
           patient is anticipated or if the patient has diarrhea, a colostomy, or wound
           drainage not covered by a dressing.

           6.5.5.7.3.5. Hospital. Limit the movement or transport of the patient from the
           room.

           6.5.5.7.3.6. Hospital. Ensure that patient-care items, bedside equipment, and
           frequently touched surfaces receive daily cleaning.

           6.5.5.7.3.7. Hospital. Dedicate use of noncritical patient-care equipment to a
           single patient or cohort of patients with the same pathogen. If not feasible,
           adequate disinfection between patients is necessary.

           6.5.5.7.3.8. Tent. Any patient or group of patients suspected of having an illness
           spread via contact should be separated, either by distance or a barrier such as a
           curtain, from the rest of the patients. This is not because the germs will jump
           from patient to patient but instead to act as a reminder to healthcare workers that
           this particular patient requires something extra.

           6.5.5.7.3.9. Tent. Guidance for wearing personal protective attire (PPA):
           Gloves are required when entering the patient’s cubical or providing direct care.
           Gown and gloves are required for all personnel and visitors when in close or
           direct contact with the patient, or used patient equipment (e.g., over bed table,
           etc.), or supplies. Close contact is defined as within 3 feet of the patient or
           contaminated equipment or furniture. If the patient has an ileostomy, colostomy,
           or diarrhea, gowns are required at all times.

           6.5.5.7.3.10. Tent. Guidance for transporting the patient within the tent: For
           personnel transporting the patient, wear gloves and preferably an isolation gown.
           Cover the patient with a clean sheet.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   53




  6.5.6. Patient Movement in NBC Environments.

     6.5.6.1. Patient evacuation must be conducted, even in contaminated environments.
     Operation in NBC contamination may slow evacuation and increase patient holding
     times. Adequate planning and training will help to mitigate these difficulties.

     6.5.6.2. Evacuation may be conducted using personnel, vehicles, or aircraft. Use of
     personnel to physically carry casualties is labor intensive and difficult in IPE and adverse
     climatic conditions. This should only be used for short distances. Ground vehicles are
     readily available and are easier to decontaminate and replace than aircraft. The primary
     means of evacuation will be by ground vehicle.

     6.5.6.3. The NBC environment forces the commander to consider what assets will be
     committed to evacuation from the contaminated area. Minimize the number of medical
     evacuation assets that are exposed to contamination, taking into account the number and
     rate of casualties requiring evacuation. Use those vehicles that are already contaminated
     prior to committing additional assets to the contaminated area. Consider use of non-
     medical vehicles of opportunity that are already contaminated. If possible, dirty vehicles
     should not leave the contaminated area. Use these vehicles to shuttle patients to the
     decontamination or transload point. If contaminated vehicles must travel outside of the
     contaminated area, use the same route for all contaminated vehicles to travel to the
     decontamination area and return. This route should be considered “dirty” and should not
     be crossed by clean vehicles or troops. The route should be coordinated with higher
     headquarters and the host nation to prevent unintended exposure of vehicles or personnel.
     Patient protective wraps (PPWs) should be used to protect decontaminated patients if
     they must be transported through contaminated areas.

     6.5.6.4. Helicopter rotorwash may disturb contaminants on the ground posing a risk of
     contamination to adjacent areas. The landing zone should not be located upwind of
     decontamination or “clean” areas.

     6.5.6.5. Fixed wing air evacuation may be limited. Contaminated casualties should be
     transported by ground vehicles and decontaminated prior to entry into the MASF or air
     evacuation holding area. Air evacuation of potentially contaminated patients requires the
     approval of the destination country, and of any country where the aircraft will land or
     overfly. Foreign nations may not permit contaminated aircraft to land or overfly their
     airspace. Coordination between the supported combatant commander and Department of
     State may be required. Authorization to transport contaminated patients on US Air Force
     aircraft requires approval of the Theater and US Transportation Command combatant
     commanders. If an aircraft is committed to the contamination zone, patients should be
     decontaminated prior to transfer to clean aircraft, vehicles, or facilities. This should be
     accomplished at a remote transload point or isolated ramp area, keeping in mind the off-
     load and decontamination areas will become contaminated. (Refer to AFTTP 3-42.5,
     Aeromedical Evacuation, for additional information.)
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                54




     6.5.6.6. Air evacuation personnel should be able to provide en route care for NBC
     casualties. Normally casualties will be decontaminated prior to air evacuation. However,
     biologic casualties may remain infectious. The US Army maintains an Aeromedical
     Isolation Team (AIT) at USAMRIID. This is a rapid response team designed to safely
     evacuate and manage patients with potentially lethal communicable diseases under high-
     level containment. The AIT cannot provide mass casualty evacuation.

     6.5.6.7.    Air evacuation crews should have required immunizations and
     chemoprophylaxis. Capabilities for isolation of infectious casualties and disposal of
     contaminated wastes need to be in place. Procedures for decontamination of non-
     disposable medical equipment should be identified. All Air Evacuation personnel should
     know isolation and universal protective precautions and be competent in operation in
     required personal protective equipment to include IPE. Protocols for transport of
     contaminated and infectious patients should be developed and exercised for each air
     evacuation platform.

  6.5.7. Management of Human Remains.

     6.5.7.1. Management of human remains is primarily a Services responsibility. The
     medical community advises to protect health and prevent the spread of disease. For more
     information, reference JP 4-06, JTTP for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations and
     AFMAN 10-2602 [Draft], Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional Defense
     Operations and Standards.

     6.5.7.2. Human remains should be rendered safe for transportation into the United States
     and for release to mortuaries. Remains should be evacuated to military port mortuaries in
     CONUS. Remains contaminated by chemical agents can normally be rendered safe by
     external decontamination. Biologically contaminated remains must be embalmed and
     transported in appropriate sealed containers.

     6.5.7.3. The Mortuary Affairs Decontamination Collection Point (MADCP) is an
     operational element under oversight of the Joint Mortuary Affairs Office (JMAO). The
     MADCP is staffed by specialized mortuary affairs and NBC defense personnel. In the
     event of a large number of NBC casualties spread over a wide area, the resources of the
     MADCP may be overwhelmed. Local initial decontamination or contaminated remains
     collection points may need to be established. US Air Force, mortuary affairs activities
     are performed by Services personnel. Medical consultation may be required in the event
     of contaminated casualties. Large numbers of contaminated remains may require
     alternative procedures. If adequate decontamination capability is not available,
     contaminated remains may have to be buried in place. The area commander, with
     consultation of the JMAO, may authorize mass burials.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   55



                                          Chapter 7

                                         LOGISTICS

7.1. General. Protecting medical supplies and equipment from the effects of NBC
contamination is absolutely essential to maintaining operational capability of any deployed
medical unit. The Medical Logistics Supply Chain must be able to deliver essential medical
supplies in an NBC environment. Medical supplies must continue to arrive at the deployed
location free of contamination and in serviceable condition. Deployed medical units must be
able to protect their limited supply stocks from becoming lost due to NBC attack.

7.2. Protecting Medical Materiel on Site.

   7.2.1. Every effort must be made to protect all medical supplies and equipment during NBC
   defense operations. This includes materiel kept at the various sections throughout the DMF.
   Placing supplies and equipment under sufficient cover will decrease the potential for loss.
   Supplies should be wrapped in plastic and placed under tents or stored in CP locations if
   possible. Wrapping supplies in two layers of plastic with M-8 paper placed on the outer
   layer to assist in the identification of post-attack chemical agent contamination. The thicker
   the plastic the longer it will protect.

   7.2.2. Plastic wrap is not part of allowance standards and must be obtained prior to
   deployment into an NBC threat area or obtained immediately upon notification of an
   increasing threat. Base supply or CE is the source for plastic coverings; contact them prior
   to deployment to palletize necessary supplies.

   7.2.3. Protection from the thermal and blast effects of nuclear detonations requires more
   elaborate measures. Placing supplies in trenches, inside earthen berms, behind substantial
   stonewalls, or in other field expedient depressions or facilities will enhance the protective
   posture of supplies and equipment from nuclear effects.

7.3. Protecting Medical Materiel During Transportation.

   7.3.1. Normal transportation methods offer a reasonable amount of protection from BW/CW
   agents by virtue of their design. Supplies are normally shipped in boxes that are transported
   in closed aircraft and or trucks. In addition to being placed in boxes most items are shrink-
   wrapped and or placed under plastic if built onto a 463L aircraft pallet.

   7.3.2. Supplies en route are most vulnerable when awaiting transfer at transshipment nodes.
   It is recommended that supplies destined for a known NBC environment or a designated high
   threat area be placed in plastic bags or wrapped in plastic before being placed in shipping
   boxes or containers. This will further protect the cargo from exposure. This extra protection
   will add minimal procedural changes at the source of supply and the deployed location.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                  56



   7.3.3. Coordination with the sustaining base must be made to ensure steps are taken with
   vendors and other sources of supply to protect cargo during and immediately after
   transportation.

7.4. Biomedical Maintenance Support in an NBC Environment.

   7.4.1. To minimize exposure to NBC agents or materials, medical equipment should be
   covered with plastic or tarps when practical. Maintenance on biomedical equipment will
   become more complex under NBC conditions.

   7.4.2. After exposure, the decontamination of some medical equipment may be a problem
   for maintenance personnel. The use of standard decontamination agents may cause damage
   beyond repair to some biomedical and electronic equipment. In some instances, removal of
   chemical agents from medical equipment will require aging (off gassing).

   7.4.3. Decontamination of biomedical equipment must be performed in MOPP Level 4 until
   decontamination is completed.

7.5. Biological Warfare/Chemical Warfare (BW/CW) Personal Protection Items. The
chemical/biological ensemble provides adequate protection for most internal radiological
hazards. An area contaminated with radioactive material would require the donning of a lead
suit as protection from the external radiation hazards. However, the donning of mask, gloves,
and boot covers will minimize the inhalation and ingestion of radiological contamination.

   7.5.1. Issue. When directed by appropriate authority BW/CW individual protection items
   will be issued IAW AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 5, chapter 15. This
   means that most units arriving in-theater will receive their BW/CW protection items prior to
   deployment and have them when they arrive. Units already in theater will require their
   BW/CW items to be issued when notified by the appropriate authority. There will also be
   units and individuals arriving in-theater without some or all of their BW/CW items. They too
   must be issued their required BW/CW items IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 5, chapter 15.
   Recognize that medical logistics must be able to accommodate units or individuals that will
   require occasional re-issue of some or all items due to various reasons. This means it may be
   necessary for deployed medical logistics activities to periodically requisition BW/CW items
   through the established supply chain.

   7.5.2. Accountability. The procedures in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 5, chapter 15, will
   account for quantity and lot numbers issued. This provides a starting point for possible
   quality assurance recall actions. They also provide a starting point for implementing
   investigational new drug (IND) protocol accountability requirements if applicable. Troop
   commanders and individuals are to maintain accountability of the items from time of issue
   until turn-in. The medical logistics activity cannot account for BW/CW items once they are
   issued to units or individuals.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     57



  7.5.3. Turn-in. The turn-in of all unused BW/CW individual protective items will be
  accepted by the issuing medical logistics activity. If this is not feasible, assets may be
  returned to any Air Force medical logistics activity. At recurrent deployment sites,
  prepositioning assets at the deployed location based on the UMD will reduce wastage of
  supplies. BW/CW items turned back in will not be considered for re-issue. Medical logistics
  activities will separate turn-in items and hold them until disposition instructions are provided.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     58



                                           Chapter 8

                               EDUCATION AND TRAINING

8.1. General.

   8.1.1. The role of the Air Force HSS in the NBC environment is to mitigate and to minimize
   the effects of NBC wounds, injuries, and disease in order to maintain and sustain sortie
   generation. It is through education and training that Air Force medical personnel will obtain
   the necessary counter NBC operational skills required to ensure an optimal degree of success.

   8.1.2. The goal of education and training, formal or informal, is to impart a working
   knowledge of the concepts, principles, and procedures of operating in the NBC environment.
   This education and training shall address the individual, collective unit, and leadership skills
   needed to support combatant commander requirements.

   8.1.3. It is clear that there is a core set of skill requirements that apply to every medic,
   regardless of specialty. However, the level of expertise brought to bear on the NBC event
   will determine the breath and depth of understanding and level of proficiency. Through
   education, the basis for training will be established. Training will include hands-on exposure
   to NBC defense techniques and procedures, and exercises. Stressing, realistic exercises are
   the best ways in which to demonstrate and revalidate operational capability of the medical
   response to an NBC event. These exercises will not only reinforce skill sets but will serve to
   provide a tool to objectively measure the desired mission outcome. In the end, the desired
   goal of all NBCCDT is to develop a working knowledge of the required skill set and to
   demonstrate an appropriate level of proficiency.

   8.1.4. The combination of core skill requirements and mission specific or UTC specific
   requirements represent the full-spectrum requisite NBC training. The Manpower and
   Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) for each UTC establishes a mission essential task
   list (METL) which identifies the key skills required by UTC members to function effectively
   in the NBC environment. UTC-specific training requirements are derived from the METLs.

   8.1.5. Medical readiness education and training building blocks begins with initial training
   received upon entry into the Service and continues with periodic refresher training throughout
   the lifecycle of the Service member. The pieces of the blocks can best be described in three
   phases: initial training, sustainment training, and just-in-time (JIT) training. (See Figure 8.1.)

                          Figure 8.1. Training Building Blocks

     8.1.5.1. Initial Training. Initial NBCCDT will occur at the accession/entry-level
     courses. NBCCDT is described in AFI 10-2501 (Draft), Full Spectrum Threat Response
     (FSTR) Planning and Operations, and includes, but is not limited to, the proper use of
     individual protective equipment (IPE). For the enlisted, these entry-level courses may
     include Basic Military Training (BMT) at Lackland AFB, the Expeditionary Medical
     Readiness Course (EMRC) at Sheppard AFB, or Basic Expeditionary Medical Readiness
     Training (BEMRT) at Brooks AFB. Officers receive initial training by attending the
     Commissioned Officer Training (COT)/Reserve Commissioned Officer Training (RCOT)
     course, or through a commissioning program such as a Service academy, Reserve Officer
     Training Corps (ROTC), or Officer Training School. All personnel that do not receive
     NBCCDT through these accession programs must be trained at the unit level within 6
     months of their assignment.

     8.1.5.2. Sustainment Training.

        8.1.5.2.1. Air Force specialty code (AFSC) sustainment training (AFSC-specific
        Readiness Skills Verification Program [RSVP]) is designed to maintain medical skills
        of a fully qualified member to adequately perform the duties required by the
        member’s AFSC in a deployed setting. All personnel assigned to deployable UTCs
        must participate in appropriate AFSC specific training. MAJCOMs may provide
        supplemental guidance for all other medical personnel (e.g., nondeployable UTCs, in-
        place/generation/forward deployed units, CONUS reception/expansion, and those
        personnel not assigned to UTCs) to complete RSVP training, based on readiness
        missions.

        8.1.5.2.2. Enlisted personnel enter into the sustainment training upon award of the 5-
        skill level. Officers enter sustainment training after completion of unit orientation
        program and completion of a fully qualified AFSC.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     60




           8.1.5.2.3. The RSVP training database, maintained by the Wartime Medical Planning
           System Office (WAR-MED PSO) is the primary guide for medical specialty specific
           medical readiness training. Units will use AFSC specific training RSVP requirements
           as part of their annual medical readiness training plan to ensure that every opportunity
           to conduct training is identified, planned, and documented appropriately. Training
           tasks, which are identified in the AFSC specific sustainment training database, are the
           catalyst for training program development.

           8.1.5.2.4. Several venues for sustainment training that address AFSC-specific and
           UTC-specific requirements are available to medical personnel. Formal courses
           provide an opportunity for a standardized approach to training. Additionally,
           maximum utilization of distance learning capabilities will be integral in reducing
           temporary duty (TDY) costs and time away from home station. Reference materials
           (e.g., NBC toolkit, CD-ROM training, etc.) should be incorporated as needed to
           augment initial training.

       8.1.5.3. Just-in-time (JIT) Training. Although JIT training is a component of education
       and training, it is not the optimal or desired method of training. Therefore, JIT training
       should occur just prior to the deployment phase (predeployment) of the operation or
       while deployed. The goal of JIT training is immediate reenforcement of critical NBC
       skills only (e.g., wear of the protective mask, proper inspection of individual protective
       equipment [IPE], use of auto-injectors, etc.).

   8.1.6. Field Exercises. Training conducted outside the classroom, normally employing unit
   equipment, and operating under simulated NBC conditions. An example of a field exercise is
   a circumstance in which a unit focuses on setting up its medical equipment and simulates all
   aspects of the deployment phase of an NBC operation. Essential elements of the exercise
   should include aspects of triage, decontamination, treatment, and transportation of casualties.
   These tasks should be performed both with and without IPE.

8.2. Core NBC Requirements. Core requirements are those essential or critical NBC training
requirements that if not received would significantly degrade the individual’s or unit’s ability to
operate in an NBC environment. These critical skills, common to every medic regardless of
deployment status, forward location, or home-based assignment, are identified in support of the
three pillars of force health protection (FHP): healthy and fit force, casualty prevention, and
casualty care management, as outlined in AFDD 2-4.2, Health Services, and JP 4-02 [Final
Draft], Doctrine for Health Service Support in Joint Operations. Specifically, all health care
providers must attend in-residence or take by satellite course the following courses: Medical
Management of Biological Casualties Course (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, Maryland), Medical
Management of Chemical Casualties Course (USAMRICD, Aberdeen, Maryland), and Medical
Effects of Ionizing Radiation Course (AFRRI, Bethesda, Maryland). Enlisted medical personnel
should attend the Field Management of Chemical and Biological Casualties Course
(USAMRIID/USAMRICD). Attachment 5 contains a list of NBC references for health care
providers.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                61




  8.2.1. Healthy and Fit Force. A healthy and fit force increases resiliency to overcome
  adversity. All personnel should make every effort to promote emotional and physical health
  and fitness, both individually and as a unit. The DMC’s leadership skills will include:

     8.2.1.1. Planning factors:

         8.2.1.1.1. Chain of command/lines of communication.

         8.2.1.1.2. Threat.

         8.2.1.1.3. Unique factors during predeployment, deployment and postdeployment
         phases of operations (e.g., plans, vulnerability assessments, beddown considerations,
         lessons learned, etc.).

         8.2.1.1.4. Required capability necessary to meet threat.

         8.2.1.1.5. Combat stress control.

     8.2.1.2. Logistics considerations:

         8.2.1.2.1. Protecting materiel.

         8.2.1.2.2. Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) support.

         8.2.1.2.3. Issuing BW/CW countermeasures.

  8.2.2. Casualty Prevention. Core requirements for casualty prevention will include the
  following passive defense actions:

     8.2.2.1. Contamination avoidance.

     8.2.2.2. Decontamination.

     8.2.2.3. IPE.

     8.2.2.4. Chemoprophylaxis.

     8.2.2.5. Medical intelligence/NBC threat to base population.

     8.2.2.6. In-processing immunization.

     8.2.2.7. Prevention.

     8.2.2.8. Infection control.
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                   62




     8.2.2.9. Containment.

  8.2.3. Casualty Care Management. Core requirements for casualty care management will
  include:

     8.2.3.1. First responder—those units/personnel who are first on the scene when medical
     care is required. These individuals provide initial life saving/life sustaining care to NBC
     casualties prior to the transport of the patient to the next level of care. These situations
     include, but are not limited to in-flight emergencies (IFEs), mass casualty situations,
     hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response, and other emergency responses. In some
     cases, triage teams may be classified as first responders. All 4NOX1 first responders will
     be nationally registered as Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)-Basic as a minimum
     level of qualification. Physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and IDMTs who also may
     ride in ambulances, will have even higher levels of certification and inherently meet this
     requirement.

     8.2.3.2. Principles of the phases of care:

        8.2.3.2.1. Triage.

        8.2.3.2.2. Decontamination.

        8.2.3.2.3. Treatment.

        8.2.3.2.4. Transportation.

     8.2.3.3. Self-aid/buddy care (SABC).

     8.2.3.4. Surgical stabilization.

     8.2.3.5. Surveillance (disease, vector).

     8.2.3.6. Security.

     8.2.3.7. Medical management of NBC casualties.

            8.2.3.7.1. Pathophysiology.

            8.2.3.7.2. Clinical effects/presentation.

            8.2.3.7.3. Medical management (prophylaxes).

            8.2.3.7.4. Protective measures and containment (isolation, universal precautions).
AFTTP 3-42.3 26 AUGUST 2002                                                                     63



8.3. Summary

   8.3.1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff has identified four resources of measurement to determine
   the readiness of any unit. This measurement tool, known as the Status of Resources and
   Training System (SORTS), assesses equipment/supplies, equipment/supplies condition,
   personnel, and training. Of these, training is by far the easiest to influence for optimal
   effectiveness.

   8.3.2. Education and training is a vital determinant to the success or failure in any operation,
   whether in an NBC environment or conventional. Education and training of Air Force
   Medical Service personnel in support of combatant commander requirements and FHP
   activities will minimize the medical effects of an NBC event on operational units and
   increase survivability during NBC environments.

NBC-Related AFMS UTCs. UTC CONOPS can be located at USAF/SGX homepage,
https://www.afms.mil/sgxr/index.cfm.

Wartime Medical Decontamination Team (WMDT)(UTCs FFGLA and FFGLB): UTC
FFGLA is equipment and UTC FFGLB is a 19-person team. Provides decontamination (decon)
personnel to support theater bed-down locations as determined by the medical planner. The
Patient Decontamination Team consists of medical personnel and is equipped to decontaminate
500 patients over a 30-day period without resupply. Each Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) is
authorized and may require two personnel teams per equipment set, capable of operating on a 24-
hour basis. Low threat areas may have one team assigned at the discretion of the Theater
AFFOR/ASETF Surgeon.

Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) Nuclear/Biological/Chemical (NBC) Team (UTC
FFGL1) (Note, this UTC is undergoing modernization to a new name (Medical NBC Team)
and reduction in personnel size to 3 persons; ECD for revision is Sep 02): Provides increased
wing survivability through NBC surveillance, detection, and abatement. Advises wing survival
recovery center (SRC) on NBC threats, decontamination options, personnel protective equipment
capabilities, and NBC health risk to deployed personnel. Provides field NBC detection through
augmentation of the base NBC Defense Cell. Advises SRC on threat impact, protective action,
and recovery activities. This six-member team includes equipment.

Biological Augmentation Team (BAT) (UTC FFBAT): Provides advanced diagnostic
identification capability for pathogens of operational concern at the deployed location. Team
members analyze samples and interpret results using a nucleic acid based testing platform. The
two-member team deploys based on threat assessments and may deploy along with the EMEDS
forces or individually, depending on mission needs.

Infectious Disease: Provides infectious disease augmentation to an AFTH with two UTCs:
FFHA2, Infectious Disease Team, and FFHA5, Infectious Disease Augmentation Team.

   Infectious Disease Team (UTC FFHA2): Provides infectious disease support and
   equipment to 25-bed or larger AFTH facilities (generally centrally located at one to three
   locations per theater). The 15-member team (consisting of one infectious disease physician,
   a clinical nurse trained in infection control, six clinical nurses, six medical technicians, and
   one public health technician) identifies, controls, and provides treatment for infectious
   diseases in the deployed theater. The team provides public health surveillance and
   specialized care for patients with biological warfare, nosocomial, and DNBI infections
   transmissible to other patients and personnel. Identifies, confirms, and reports use of
   biological warfare agents. Provides consultation to preventive medicine teams, uses
   telemedicine capabilities for consultation with theater epidemiology team (UTC FFHA1),

   BEE NBC team (UTC FFGL1), and CONUS-based medical and all biological and infectious
   disease centers. Oversees operation of six-bed patient isolation area.

   Infectious Disease Augmentation Team (UTC FFHA5): Provides two personnel who
   provide manpower to augment infectious disease and infection control support in the theater.
   Normally deploys after UTC FFHA2 to AFTHs with more than 100 beds where a significant
   threat of biological warfare or infectious disease casualties exists. Augments ability to
   identify, control, and provide treatment for infectious diseases and biological warfare agents
   in the theater. Provides intratheater infectious disease consultation.

Theater Epidemiology Team (TET) (UTC FFHA1): Provides theater level support to Air
Force component command surgeon or joint task force surgeon.                Provides medical
environmental and occupational threat assessments, support for outbreak investigations, and
recommendations for preventive countermeasures and needed surveillance systems. Coordinates
with other medical and line force protection teams and with federal and international agencies.
Collocated with their theater surgeon or appropriate headquarters element.

Air Force Radiation Assessment Team (AFRAT): The AFRAT Nuclear Incident Response
Force (NIRF) 1 and 2(FFRA1 and FFRA2), and the Radioanalytical Assessment Team (RAT)
(FFRA3) are globally responsive specialty asset teams that provide specialized field radiological
monitoring and consequence management support to the assigned theater medical authority. The
team measures, analyzes and interprets radiological measurements in and around the affected
area. Team capabilities include radiological dose rate measurements, air concentrations, ground
deposition, and plume modeling. They provide expert guidance on the type and degree of
radiological hazard that face deployed forces. Based on these assessments, recommendations are
made to optimize force protection in light of achieving mission objectives. Typical deployment
scenarios could include consequence management operations from nuclear weapons accidents
(Broken Arrows), nuclear reactor accidents (Faded Giants), and terrorist use of radiological
dispersion weapons or improvised nuclear devices, or humanitarian assistance operations to
countries that have experienced a nuclear exchange. The AFRAT NIRF 1 consists of two health
physicists, two Bioenvironmental Engineering Craftsman, two Bioenvironmental Engineering
Journeyman and one Instrument Craftsman. AFRAT NIRF 2 consists of four Health Physicists,
two Bioenvironmental Engineers, six Bioenvironmental Engineering Craftsman, six
Bioenvironmental Engineering Journeyman, and two Instrument Craftsman. The activation of
these assets would be scaled to the specific mission needs. AFRAT NIRF 1 only, or AFRAT
NIRF 1 followed by NIRF 2.
