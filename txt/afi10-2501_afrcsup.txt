1.6.2. Each Numbered Air Force (NAF) will ensure their geographically separated units (GSUs)
have a host base/unit assigned to provide training. GSUs are units located a significant distance
from its Air Force main operating base support function.

2.4.1.2. For each EMWG develop an agenda and produce meeting minutes to document and
track action items and distribute to EMWG members and commanders. Agenda items include
but are not limited to issues and goals for training, exercising, evaluating, equipping Emergency
Management response elements, Mobility bags funding and issues, PEC 55166 requirements
and SAV/ORE trends. Tenant and associate wings/units will provide a representative to attend
the host EMWG. Tenant and associate wings/units will establish an internal forum to address
AFRC issues. Forward issues that cannot be resolved at wing/unit level to the appropriate
NAF/HQ functional for resolution.

2.4.2. Paragraph 2.4.2. and sub-paragraphs 2.4.2.1. - 2.4.2.10. apply to AFRC installations and
stations. Tenant wings and units must understand the AFIMS disaster response structure for use
at deployed locations and during operational readiness exercises and inspections.

301 FW NAS JRB Ft Worth, 911 AW Pittsburgh ARS, and 934 AW Minneapolis St. Paul ARS,
will base their CEMP 10-2 on recovery operations as the municipality airport provides the
emergency response capability for major accidents.

3.6.1.17. The Regional Support Group (RSG) Emergency Management (EM) functional will use
the applicable host or tenant HQ AFRC Emergency Management Unit Compliance Checklist to
conduct SAVs. Units may request a NAF functional area visits (FAV) at anytime through their
chain of command. SAVs and FAVs conducted by the RSG Emergency Management
functionals will not exceed 36 months between visits.

3.6.1.18. Readiness and Emergency Management Flights will use the HQ AFRC EM Unit
Compliance Checklist to conduct unit level SAVs and self inspections. RSG, EM offices and
tenant EM functionals can supplement the HQ AFRC checklist.

3.6.1.19. RSG EM functionals will forward trends and issues to AFRC/A7XEM as they become
apparent. Each RSG will provide a complete list of SAV trends for the previous calendar year to

3.7.4.3.2. (Added) HQ AFRC/A7XEM will not establish direct contact with the tenant
Emergency Management functionals without first attempting to contact the respective RSG EM
functional. In the absence of the RSG EM functional, the HQ can contact the unit directly and
will follow-up with an e-mail to the RSG EM functional.

3.7.4.3.3. (Added) HQ AFRC/SGPB is authorized direct communication with the base
Bioenvironmental Engineering program office at non-co-located AFRC bases.

3.7.4.4. (Added) The RSG EM functional provides direct oversight of the military emergency
management program at AFRC wings, groups, squadrons, flights and GSUs. Ensures unit level
airmen are prepared to conduct, respond, and recover operations when faced with emergency
management and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high yield explosive (CBRNE)
incidents while deployed.

3.10.1. The Emergency Management office is the OPR at AFRC host locations. AFRC tenant
wings must establish an internal emergency management program supporting the host
emergency management program. The internal AFRC emergency management program will
also address issues supporting deployed contingency operations. The R&EM flight ART or full
time civilian equivalent is the tenant wing liaison to the host. All other AFRC units (GSUs and
DFUs) will have an internal Emergency Management program supporting the host Emergency
Management program.

support of natural disaster shelters.

3.10.14. As a minimum, AFRC host locations will have a shelter-in-place plan for all facilities
on the installation. AFRC EM functional at non AF installations will have a shelter in place plan
for all their facilities. AFRC tenant and associate units must support the host shelter-in-place
plan. The plan will include the following information: shelter location in the facility, location of
environmental controls, and who to contact to have the system turned off, and procedures on
how to improve the protection factor of the shelter location based on the incident.

3.10.15. The expedient contamination control capability applies only to AFRC host locations.

3.11.1. Appoint, in writing, a primary and alternate representative. To ensure program integrity,
primary duty 3E9X1 Emergency Management personnel will not be assigned as unit EM

2s, the RST augments the Emergency Management Office. RST staffing is identified in the wing
supplement to this document or the CEMP 10-2. All units on the installation/station shall
proportionately provide staffing for the RST. Staff the RST for a 24-hour capability with
military, civilian and contractor personnel, from those positions least likely to deploy. Use of
civilians must be approved by civilian personnel and contract personnel must be approved by the
contracting office. Activation of the RST will be identified in the CEMP 10-2. NOTE: Trained
personnel shall not be relieved from their assignment/duties until replaced by a fully trained
individual. All RST members must meet physical and medical requirements/qualifications for the
expected support duties.

4.3. Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. At AFRC installations
and stations, the Emergency Management Office is the OPR for the CEMP Plan 10-2.

4.3.1. Organizations at AFRC installations and stations coordinate unit developed CEMP 10-2
checklists with the Emergency Management Office. At AFRC tenant locations, organizations
coordinate all unit-developed checklists supporting the host CEMP 10-2 through the AFRC
tenant CE Readiness and Emergency Management Flight prior to submission to the host base.
Unit commanders and the functional area will ensure checklists are reviewed annually.
Document review per local instructions and provide copies of all checklists to the appropriate
RSG Emergency Management functional.

4.3.7.3. Annex C: AFRC installations are not required an Annex C.

5.6.1. (Added) HQ AFRC/A7XEM is the PE55166 assistant Program Element Manager (PEM)
for AFRC and works in close coordination with the PEM in AF/RE. The Emergency
Management Office is the focal point at AFRC installation/stations. The Readiness and
Emergency Management Flight is the focal point for tenant units.

5.6.2. (Added) HQ AFRC/SGPB is the PE 28036F and PE 58211F functional Program Element
Manager (PEM) for Medical CBRNE equipment. The Bioenvironmental Engineering/Public
Health Office is the focal point at AFRC installations/stations.

5.8.1. (Added) The EMWG will meet no later than the first week of February to identify
POM/APOM and mid-year unfunded requirements and ensure funding is at least 40% obligated.
The EMWG will also meet no later than the last week in July to identify end-of-year unfunded
requirements. Budgets are submitted according the HQ AFRC Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Operations Program Procedural Information Message (PIM)
08-010.

6.4.1. AFRC personnel must hold a 3E951 AFSC or higher and be evaluated by a 3E971 or
higher to conduct these classes. All new AFRC Emergency Management military and civilian
members must submit a request to attend initial courses (Emergency Management
Apprentice/Readiness and Emergency Management Flight Officer) within the first month of
assignment. Another Joint Service‘s technical training cannot be waivered to fulfill this
requirement. Units may budget for and sponsor AETC traveling teams as well as those from
federal, state and local agencies as an alternative for formal in residence training that is not
mandated to attend a specific course. The AFRC Expeditionary Combat Support-Training and
Certification Center, Dobbins ARB, GA provides additional hand-on wartime task training
opportunities. Report the completion of training to the appropriate RSG EM functional.
AFI 10-2501_AFRCSUP 6 FEBRUARY 2009                                                       7

6.6.1.1. (Added) At AFRC installations, Emergency Management personnel (3E9X1) (military,
government civilians, and qualified contactors) will conduct this training unless otherwise noted
in Table 6.3.

6.6.1.2.1. Every attempt must be made to accomplish CBRNE Defense Awareness using the
Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS).

6.6.1.3.1. Reserve Emergency Management personnel will not conduct more than one CBRNE
Defense Training (CBRNE Defense Awareness Course / CBRNE Defense Survival Skills) class
per calendar year. The primary mission of the emergency management traditional reservist is to
acquire the knowledge and proficiency required to fight and operate in a wartime environment.
At tenant locations, the instruction of CBRNE Defense Awareness Course / CBRNE Defense
Survival Skills remains the responsibility of the host Readiness and Emergency Management
Flight. To facilitate upgrade training requirements, AFRC Emergency Management 3-levels will
not teach CBRN Defense Courses during UTAs until all 5-level upgrade requirements are met.
Once met, 3-levels can instruct with the proper supervision of a qualified instructor (5-level or
higher). During the demonstration performance portion of CBRNE Defense Survival Skills
Training, the instructor to student ratio is one instructor for every ten students.

6.7. Emergency Management Information Program. At AFRC installations and stations, the
Emergency Management Office is responsible for disseminating this information to the
installation.

6.7.2.2. In the absence of a host information program, the tenant Readiness and Emergency
Management Flight will notify their respective RSG if the host Readiness and Emergency
Management Flight does not have an EM information program.

7.3.1. Documentation of all exercises is required. Units will use the compliance inspection
grading criteria in the AFRC supplement to AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. The
format is a letter of memorandum with attachments where necessary. All exercise requirements
apply to AFRC installations. One exception is 301 FW NAS JRB Ft Worth, 911 AW Pittsburgh
ARS, and 934 AW Minn St Paul ARS do not have an emergency response capability so for
major accident those units are required to only the recovery phase of the exercise. At all AFRC
locations, the military wings only conduct OREs.

7.3.2. (Added) Types of exercises can be combined to reduce the number of exercises each year.
Exercise reports must be detailed enough to show the intent of each specific exercise requirement
was accomplished.

7.4.10. (Added) AFRC units subject to gaining MAJCOM ORIs will conduct an ORE based
upon the gaining MAJCOM ORI scenario. Exercise length must be adequate to ensure exercise
objectives of command and control; attack warning reactions; use of individual equipment;
contamination control area processing; contamination avoidance; self-aid and buddy care;
explosive ordnance reconnaissance; dispersal; expedient hardening; blackout; and demonstrated
effectiveness of personnel to perform their wartime tasks in a chemical-biological warfare

environment are accomplished. The unit conducting the ORE documents the results, and assigns
OPRs, OCRs and ECDs to all discrepancies. The EET Chief will track to completion.

7.5.1. All AFRC wings (groups at locations without wings) must establish an EET.

7.5.2. Appoint in writing a full-time member as the EET Chief, minimum grade of major or
civilian equivalent, and an alternate EET Chief. These personnel can be from any organization
or career field. Primary duty Emergency Management personnel are not assigned as the EET
chief or designated to manage any aspect of exercise. However, Emergency Management
personnel are an integral part of exercise scenario development. All AFRC wings must establish
an exercise evaluation team

7.6. Installation Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Chief. Base exercise scenarios on local
conditions, aircraft type, vulnerability assessment team (VAT) results and CEMP 10-2 Plan.

7.6.3. The tenant wing/unit commander or designee (i.e., EET Chief) must coordinate with the
host exercise evaluation team chief to incorporate the tenant in exercise planning and execution.

7.6.8. (Added) At tenant AFRC units, the EET is structured to evaluate mobility commitment
exercises.

7.6.9. (Added) EET Chiefs consider conducting Anti Terrorism exercise requirements from AFI
10-245, paragraph 2.6.4.5. in conjunction with one of the EM exercises.

7.6.10. (Added) The EET Chief consults with the Emergency Management and
Bioenvironmental Offices for major accident, natural disaster, and terrorist use of CBRNE
exercise scenarios and with the CE Readiness and Emergency Management Flight for planning,
guidance and advice on operational readiness exercise (ORE) scenarios.

9.3. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS). AFRC uses INWS Alerts to
provide emergency notifications via email, telephone, and local area network popups. This
INWS Alerts system is available at all AFRC Wing command posts and is managed at wing level
by our command post personnel. AFRC will be adding Giant Voice integration from INWS
Alerts in the near future.

9.3.1. Updates to installation Giant Voice systems must be coordinated with HQ AFRC/A6XI to
ensure compatibility with the existing INWS Alerts system. Users submit requirements to
upgrade/replace existing Giant Voice systems through HQ AFRC/A6IA for review and technical
solution.

9.4.1. Installation Commander through the ICC. AFRC/A6XI is OPR for the AFRC Enterprise
INWS Alerts System. As such they will oversee all INWS Alerts program management
throughout its life-cycle. AFRC/A6N will provide system administrator support to the AFRC
INWS Alerts servers at both the primary and backup sites.

AFRC EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT (SAV)
                        PROCEDURE

A9.1. (Added) EM (Emergency Management) SAV Objective. The SAV is used to resolve
problems and help correct deficiencies in the base and tenant wing/group EM program.
Indications of problems should lead to assistance via a SAV. The SAV emphasizes problem
solving and is not compliance oriented. A SAV is not a substitute for routine work or continued
corrective action by the unit.

A9.2. (Added) Planning and Conducting a SAV:

A9.2.1. (Added) NAF-Sponsored SAV. NAF SAVs conducted under the auspices of the
NAF/CC are scheduled on an annual basis. Refer to the NAF schedule and guidance while
planning. The appropriate NAF guidance should be followed during a NAF-sponsored SAV.
AFRCPD 90-1 contains guidance relating to program management of assistance visits. When a
representative from HQ AFRC/A7XEM accompanies the NAF SAV that individual cannot be
the unit compliance inspection inspector for that unit.

A9.2.2. (Added) Wing/Group SAV. EM program SAVs are conducted by the MSG and tenant
Readiness and Emergency Management Flight to wing/group units according to the following
guidance. (NOTE: Parts of this guidance may be pertinent for the NAF-sponsored SAV.)

A9.2.2.1. (Added) If a unit has not had a SAV within the last 12 months, the Readiness and
Emergency Management Flight schedules a SAV within 60 days of the one-year anniversary.
The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight maintains a schedule to ensure the one year
interval is not exceeded.

A9.2.2.2. (Added) The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight uses their RSG published
EM Self-Inspection Guide (Base or Tenant) to conduct the SAV.

A9.2.2.3. (Added) If not initiated by the unit/CC, notify the commander of the unit to be visited
at least two UTAs before the SAV. Provide the visit date and names of SAV team.

A9.2.2.4. (Added) Obtain a briefing from the unit commander concerning any identified problem
area, including measures taken for resolution.

A9.2.2.5. (Added) During the SAV, identify discrepancies, provide specific guidance for their
resolution and correct problems on the spot if possible. Provide a Pre/Post SAV briefing with the
Unit/CC. Include specific solutions or assistance provided. Leave a list of observations or
findings and recommendations. If a problem is beyond the unit’s ability to correct, arrange for
follow-up assistance. (NOTE: The unit EM representative should be present during the SAV.)
Provide a written report within 2 UTAs of the SAV. Route the SAV report through the Wing
Commander and appropriate Directorate Chief to the Unit/CC. A written reply to discrepancies
will be required within 4 UTA’s of the initial SAV.

A9.2.2.6. (Added) Deficiencies noted in a SAV are tracked via the unit self-inspection program.

A9.3. (Added) Responsibilities:

A9.3.1. (Added) RSG Emergency Management:

A9.3.1.1. (Added) Provides guidance for conducting EM program SAVs.

A9.3.1.2. (Added) Analyzes SAV program trends, conducts a SAV when directed/requested
based on identified problem areas and suggests corrective measures.

A9.3.2. (Added) Emergency Management Offices. The Emergency Management Office conducts
an EM program SAV to subordinate units using the guidance above, NAF guidance, and other
guidance issued by HQ AFRC/A7XEM.

A9.3.3. (Added) MSG/Tenant Readiness and Emergency Management Flight. Manages the local
EM SAV program. Adverse trends should be presented to the Emergency Management Working
Group or other forum.

A9.4. (Added) SAV Documentation. A written trip report is required for each SAV or follow-
up SAV conducted. Use the trip report format in AFH 33-337, Tongue and Quill and the
example below. Route the report through the appropriate chain of command. Cite direct
references for discrepancies, including paragraph. Items corrected on-the-spot need not be noted
in the report unless there is a possibility of recurrence and (or) impact on other portions of the
program.
