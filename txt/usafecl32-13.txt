This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and Facilities. The
Inspection Checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, and the USAFE
Supplement 1, inspection programs. This checklist is intended for inspection use. It applies to all United
States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Civil Engineer Operations Flights and members as indicated in
paragraph 2.. It does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC)
units. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication on AF IMT 847, Recommenda-
tion for Change of Publication, to Engineering Division, HQ USAFE/A7CC, Unit 3050 Box 10, APO
AE 09094-5010. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records and disposed of in accordance
with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at: https://webrims.amc.af.mil.


1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or assessment.
As a minimum, units should use the checklist in conjunction with the Unit Self-Assessment. The objective
is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities. Higher headquarters may use
this checklist in whole or in part during visits or exercises.
   1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items identi-
   fied by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the Inspector General
   (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
       1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as key result
       areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to, items where non-com-
       pliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, litigation or affect system reliabil-
       ity. These requirements may be mandated by law, Executive Order, Department of Defense (DoD)
       directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs are referred to as significant
       guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs by using uppercase and bold letters.

       1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall perfor-
       mance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on mission performance
       but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation. Identify CGIs by using standard
       sentence case.

2. Applicability. All items on this inspection checklist are assigned an applicability code designating to
which type of unit the item applies. Applicability code 3 designates the following main operating bases
(MOB): Aviano, Incirlik, Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Ramstein and Spangdahlem. Applicability code 5 des-
ignates the following Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS) sites: Buechel, Ghedi, Kleine Brogel,
Volkel.
