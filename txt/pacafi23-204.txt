1. General.

1.1. All personnel will deploy in accordance with reporting instructions. If the host LRS
Commander cannot provide minimum essential mobility items not otherwise provided for by
Expeditionary Theater Distribution Center (ETDC), etc., request for redistribution of assets will
be reported through appropriate command channels (Numbered Air Forces) to HQ
PACAF/A4RME for action.

2. Scope.

2.1. This instruction applies to PACAF functional managers who direct and establish
requirements for mobility bags; each PACAF LRS Commander, PACAF units which require
mobility bags and activities designated to store and maintain mobility bags. AFI 23-111,
Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force, further defines individual
responsibility for the control of Air Force public property.

2.2. This instruction does not apply to tenant organizations on PACAF bases unless the tenant's
deployment requirements are in direct support of PACAF commitments and are funded by
PACAF. An exception is support for Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air Intelligence
Agency (AIA) tenant units who will determine and fund mobility bag requirements. The host
PACAF LRS Commander will manage (or store), as requested, AFRC and AIA tenant unit bags.

3. Responsibilities.

3.1. HQ PACAF/A4RME will:

3.1.1. Manage all command-wide chemical warfare defense equipment (CWDE) funding
requirements. Coordinate shortages and overages and provide requirements to HQ
PACAF/A7XS.

3.1.2. Maintain visibility and accountability of all PACAF CWDE assets and direct base-level
actions to resolve disparities.

3.1.3. Coordinate and compile PACAF input to annual Report to Congress and Quarterly Data
Calls as required by Air Staff.

3.1.4. Direct redistribution to fill critical deployment shortfalls.

3.1.5. Perform quality control of base-level records by monitoring monthly roll-up reports.

4. Determining Mobility Bag Authorizations.
PACAFI23-204        22 January 2009                                                           3

4.1. LRS Mobility Bag Function will coordinate with the applicable Logistics Plans Office to
ensure requirements are validated/received annually. Requirements need only be recomputed if
there is a 10% increase or decrease of deployment taskings during the year. Copies of the
validated requirements listing will be forwarded to HQ PACAF/A4RME no later than 1
December for review.

5. Tariff Sizing.

5.1. All units will use tariff sizing concept tailored to wing requirements, as cited in the example
from AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Pt 2, Chap. 26, Sect F, USAF Supply Manual.

6. Storage of Mobility Bags.

6.1. LRS will bulk store 90% of A, B, and C mobility bag items by NSN and further segregate
by contract/lot number to facilitate optimal inventory and shelf-life management. The remaining
10% can be pre-built and centrally stored to facilitate deployment requirements.
Note: Wing/CCs may determine that A and B bags can be stored by the units instead of the LRS
as stated in AFMAN 23-110, V2, Pt2, Ch 26, Para 26.45.1.

6.1.1. High threat areas (Korea) are exempt from centrally storing C-1 bags ONLY.

6.1.2. Installation commanders in medium threat areas (Japan) will centrally store C-1 bag items
in the LRS. C-1 bag items may be prebuilt and/or bulk stored to a percentage as deemed by the
Wing/CC to meet OPLAN requirements.

6.1.3. LRS may issue C-1 bags to Air Force emergency responders at any time.

6.1.4. LRS, as required, will update the Installation Deployment Plan, to facilitate issue of
CWDE/IPE within Designed Operational Capability (DOC)/OPLAN response times.

6.2. Storage of mobility bag items must satisfy the following minimum requirements:

6.2.1. Meet appropriate warehouse, technical data (particularly for climate control), and safety
standards IAW applicable guidance.

6.3. Store, clean, inspect, and document inspections IAW applicable technical orders.

6.4. When a bag is assembled, issued and returned, Mobility Bag Function will inspect all bag
items for serviceability and shelf-life.

7. Mobility Bag Shop Codes.
4                                                  PACAFI23-204        22 January 2009

7.1. Shop code MK will be used for non-CWDE mobility bag items. Shop code CW will be
used for CWDE mobility bag items, to include bulk stored CWDE.

8. Safety Levels.

8.1. Mobility Bag Function will maintain a 10% backup stock of C bag requirements.

9. Accountability of Mobility Bags.

9.1. Accountability of mobility bag items will be accomplished using the Mobility Inventory
Control and Accountability System (MICAS). All items must be initially cataloged into the
system upon receipt.

9.2. Mobility Bag Function will use the MICAS Community of Practice (CoP) at
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-MI-CA          to   keep
abreast with mobility issues, shelf-life messages and MICAS database updates of contract/lot
numbers. The CoP information tool is open to everyone with no membership requirement.

9.3. All MICAS users will complete computer based training (CBT) modules located at the
MICAS CoP referenced above. Training must be documented.

9.4. Mobility Bag Function will be the base focal point for all wing mobility bags regardless of
who is storing them.

9.4.1. Mobility Bag Function will prepare receipts/listings for bag components in a minimum of
two copies; one copy for the individual issued the bag(s) and the other signed and retained in
Mobility Bag Function in suspense until the bag is returned. Use locally determined products to
operate in the event of power failure, data corruption, etc.

9.4.1.1. Upon redeployment, each mobility bag will be inventoried to determine shortages and
shelf-life. Note: Shortages will be determined based on bag contents as outlined AFMAN 23-
110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chap 26, Attachment 26F-1, Attachment 26F-2, and Attachment 26F-3,
USAF Supply Manual. CWDE shelf-life is outlined in AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2, Chap 26,
Para 26.47, USAF Supply Manual.

9.5. Mobility Bag Function will develop and implement local procedures to ensure all mobility
assets are inventoried annually at a minimum. Recommend Mobility Bag Function develop a 12
month inventory schedule to account for all assets. Results will be documented and signed by
the LRS Commander then filed in Mobility Bag Function for two years.
PACAFI23-204       22 January 2009                                                          5

9.6. Mobility Bag Function will develop and implement a MICAS disaster recovery plan. The
plan will incorporate procedures to backup MICAS files and store them on an external secure
system/location (e.g., external hard drive), monthly, at a minimum.

10. Protective Masks.

10.1. Training masks are not authorized. Mobility Bag Function will ensure all masks are
accounted for in MICAS. Store, clean, inspect, and document inspections IAW most recent
update to applicable technical orders/manuals. Mobility Bag Function will issue/maintain
enough masks to cover their most stringent deployment taskings, plus a 10% backup stock of
total installation requirement. Contact HQ PACAF/A4RME before ordering any mask or mask
parts to ensure there are no pending command redistribution actions taking place. Mobility Bag
Function will maintain sufficient quantities of mask repair parts.

10.2. LRS will load requisition exception (REX) code 4 to all protective masks and mask
component parts.

10.3. Gas masks will not be stored in the C bag. In addition, long-term and short-term storage of
masks will be IAW technical orders/manuals.

11. Inspection/Shelf Life

11.1. Mobility Bag Function will sign-on to the MICAS CoP at least once a month to check for
contract/lot updates, and update their MICAS server. If more than one contract/lot update occurs
during the month, Mobility Bag Function will download and update their server with every
update posted.

11.2.     The storing activity is responsible for performing visual and shelf-life
inspections/extensions IAW applicable technical orders, allowance standard (AS) 016, and as
posted on MICAS CoP as referenced in 9.2.

11.2.1. Inspect the components of mobility bags at the time of initial assembly.

11.2.2. Inspect the components of the mobility bags at the time of issue.

operational gear IAW AFI 10-2501, Chap 5, para 5.5.2, Air Force Emergency Management (EM)
Program Planning and Operations. Unserviceable items may be used for training IAW
HAF/HQ PACAF guidance unless they have been modernized (i.e., do not use a Personal Armor
System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet in lieu of an Advanced Combat Helmet). Items will
not be rendered unserviceable in order to be used as training assets.

12.2. Units will not purchase training gear without prior approval from HQ PACAF/A4RME.
