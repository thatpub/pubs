                    TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION STANDARDS

2.1. Unit Operating Instruction. The purpose of the unit operating instruction (OI) is to
document the process by which units implement the requirements of this instruction. Post the
unit operating instruction with this instruction or other applicable supplements (hardcopy or
digital). The unit commander will approve the operating instruction. The OI will, as a
minimum, address the following items to support the unit’s training program (from initial
qualification training [IQT] through mission qualification training [MQT] to combat mission
ready [CMR] status, and into the continuation training [CT] sustainment phase) specified in this
section.
   2.1.1. Purpose, applicability, organization, and training shop manning.
   2.1.2. Unit training manager’s responsibilities.
   2.1.3. Training documentation procedures.
   2.1.4. Additional MQT and CT requirements identified in the unit MTL, as appropriate.
   2.1.5. Commander’s list of Trainers and Certifiers.
   2.1.6. Units will forward OIs to the group UTM/UOTM for review. Group UTM/UOTM
   will assist subordinate units to address all required areas.
2.2. Unit Training Process. The training requirements progress personnel from IQT, through
MQT to CMR and finally into CT.
   2.2.1. IQT training requirements are satisfied during formal training (see Chapter 3).
   2.2.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify a member in specific duty
   position(s) required to perform missions assigned to a specific unit. Completion of MQT is a
   prerequisite for CMR status.
   2.2.3. Commanders certify an individual as CMR after he or she completes IQT and MQT
   (Chapter 5).
   2.2.4. CT is unit specific training or higher headquarters identified training to maintain or
   increase CMR proficiency.
   2.2.5. Training tasks identified with a subject knowledge level code will have a test
   developed for that training task (T-3).
   2.2.6. Training tasks identified with a task performance level code will have a task
   evaluation with a “Go or No-Go” standard developed for that training task (T-3).
2.3. Training Schedule Adjustments/Extensions.
   2.3.1. Commanders may adjust the training time or remove personnel from training due to
   medical disqualification, emergency leave, deployments, or administrative action. The
   supervisor or UTM/UOTM will document adjustments in the individual’s AF Form 623a,
   On-the-Job Training Record - Continuation Sheet or TACP Training Folder.

      2.3.2. The commander may adjust the training dates for completion of requirements based
      on an individual’s TDY or emergency leave of 30 cumulative days, three (3) Unit Training
      Assemblies (UTAs) for ANG, or more. Personnel who are TDY for 30 consecutive days or 3
      UTAs or more will continue to accomplish training at temporary locations where MQT or CT
      training is available.
   2.3.3. Training extensions will be granted based on any circumstance other than TDY or
   emergency leave, that a commander determines requires a training extension. As
   circumstances dictate, unit commanders may grant an individual one training extension in
   each phase of training. Group commanders can grant a second extension. If necessary,
   MAJCOM OPRs may grant a third extension. One training extension equals 30 calendar days
   or 3 UTAs for ANG units. If training is still not complete, the MAJCOM OPR will
   determine whether or not the individual is to be removed from training.
2.4. TACP Training Folder (T-3).
   2.4.1. The TACP Training Folder is a four-part folder that documents TACP training for
   officer personnel who do not maintain a JTAC Evaluation Folder, and all unit enlisted
   personnel that do not maintain an AF Form 623 or JTAC Evaluation Folder.
         2.4.1.1. Part 1 is the “Table of Contents.”
         2.4.1.2. Part 2 is “Training Events.” This portion includes AF Form 1098s for MQT or
         CT, and any local unit training documentation. Supervisors will update these forms as
         individuals accomplish the training events. There is no need to archive hardcopy training
         from previous years. If AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring
         Training, is not filed in the individual’s TACP Training Folder, a Memorandum for
         Record (MFR) will be inserted stating that training completion information is available
         on TACTICS.
         2.4.1.3. Part 3 is the AF Form 623a.
         2.4.1.4. Part 4 is “Formal IQT Certificates.” This portion has the certificate of training
         from Air Liaison Officer Qualification Course (ALOQC) (PDS:-I3S). Include the
         ALOQC student training report until the person achieves CMR. For Intel personnel, the
         Joint Firepower Course (JFC), and Air Support Operations Center Initial Qualification
         Course (ASOC IQC) certificates will be filed. For all other operational officers, the JFC
         certificates will be filed.

                                          Chapter 5

                               COMBAT MISSION READY

5.1. General. All TACP UTC-tasked/SORTS reportable personnel and 57 OG Combat Training
School officer personnel will attain and maintain CMR status (T-1). All unit personnel that
maintain a TACP Training Folder require commander’s CMR certification annotated on the AF
Form 623a or approved automated product, and filed in Part 3 of the individual’s TACP Training
Folder (T-3). For all enlisted personnel that maintain an AF Form 623, the Commander’s CMR
certification will be annotated on their AF Form 623a (T-3). Group Commanders are not
required to be CMR or maintain CMR documentation (T-3).
5.2. CMR Requirements.
   5.2.1. Commanders certify all individuals as CMR after they complete IQT and MQT with
   the exception of 1C431s (T-3). 3-level 1C4 personnel must complete MQT and successfully
   complete a formal comprehensive initial 1C4 CMR task evaluation in accordance with Track
   1 of the USAF Operations Training Course, Tactical Air Control Party Mission Qualification
   Training Syllabus (when published), prior to commander’s certification (T-3). Task
   evaluations will be accomplished by unit task certifiers (T-3). The initial 1C4 CMR task
   evaluation will be documented in accordance with the USAF Operations Training Course,
   Tactical Air Control Party Mission Qualification Training Syllabus (when published) and
   filed in the individual’s AF Form 623 (T-3).
   5.2.2. Once a commander certifies an individual as CMR, the individual maintains CMR
   based on continuation training requirements in Chapter 6 (T-3).
   5.2.3. Group commanders certify squadron commanders CMR upon completion of training
   (T-3).
5.3. Training Task Decertification and Non-Combat Mission Ready Status.
   5.3.1. Commanders and supervisors may decertify individuals on specific training tasks,
   without loss of CMR status, for failure to meet task measurement standards (see paragraph
   5.2.2) using the following process (T-3):
       5.3.1.1. Task decertification will be annotated on the TACTICS AF Form 1098 by a unit
       Level 2 User.
       5.3.1.2. UTMs, through the individual’s supervisor, will notify the unit commander of an
       individual’s task decertification and include a proposed plan to regain certification.
       5.3.1.3. Commanders determine if the decertified task(s) warrant placing an individual in
       Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR) status. Document N-CMR status on the AF Form
       623a in Part 3 of the individual’s TACP Training Folder or AF Form 623.
5.4. Training Task Recertification and Regaining Combat Mission Ready Status.
   5.4.1. UTMs will design and accomplish (with supervisor and commander approval) a
   training task recertification plan to return an individual to CMR status. Recertification is
   complete when the individual has re-accomplished the TACTICS module and task
   evaluation, if applicable and demonstrates sufficient knowledge or skill to perform the
AFI13-113V1 14 JUNE 2012                                                                   23


  decertified task to the required standard to a trainer/certifier, and the commander’s
  endorsement is placed on the AF Form 623a, in Part 3 of the individual’s TACP Training
  Folder or annotated on AF Form 623a in the individual’s AF Form 623. AF Form 623 may
  be maintained in electronic or hardcopy format (T-3).
  5.4.2. N-CMR individuals must re-qualify on the specific, decertified items and demonstrate
  proficiency based on identified task measurement standards for each duty position task under
  the supervision of a trainer/certifier (T-3). Trainer/certifier will work with the UTM/UOTM
  and individual’s supervisor to tailor a training plan for each individual. If the N-CMR
  individual’s training plan requires being re-entered into MQT, a comprehensive duty position
  task evaluation will be accomplished. Commanders recertify CMR status, which will be
  annotated on AF Form 623a in the individual’s AF Form 623 or TACP Training Folder. AF
  Form 623 may be maintained in electronic or hardcopy format (T-3).

                                          Chapter 6

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

6.1. General. This chapter prescribes training standards to maintain CMR personnel qualified
on mission knowledge, skills, and tasks, as approved by unit commanders.
6.2. Annual/ Biennial Training Period. CT requirements are conducted on either an annual or
a biennial basis, depending on the training item, using a sliding calendar. The timing for CT
completion begins the day that the unit commander certifies the individual CMR. For example,
an academic/task training item is an annual currency and must be accomplished once every 365
days (T-3). From the day a commander certifies an individual CMR, they have 365 days to
complete their initial CT requirements. Biennial requirement are Academic/ Task and use the
same process as annual task, but on a 730 day sliding calendar (T-3).
   6.2.1. Training items that are listed as “Academic” only are biennial requirements and must
   be accomplished once every two years (730 days) (T-3). Biennial training example; an
   individual who accomplishes a biennial training item on 10 September 2009 must re-
   accomplish that event by midnight, 9 September 2011.
   6.2.2. Training items that are listed as “Academic/Task” are annual requirements and must
   be accomplished once every year (365 days) (T-3). During the initial CT cycle individuals
   must accomplish both the academic and task portions of these training items (T-3). For all
   subsequent CT cycles individuals are only required to accomplish the task associated with
   the training item, not the academic portion (T-3). If an individual is decertified on an
   individual training item, they must re-accomplish both the academic and task portions of the
   event prior to being recertified on the item (T-3). Annual training example; an individual
   who accomplishes an annual training item on 10 September 2009 must re-accomplish that
   event by midnight, 9 September 2010.
6.3. Training Events. CT requirements will be a combination of unit generated events and
computer-based training.
   6.3.1. The UTM/UOTM will create a CT plan using as a minimum, all training items
   annotated with a frequency in Table 6.1 and Table 6.2 UTMs will include any additional CT
   items required by the unit commander or higher headquarters into their unit’s CT plan (T-3).
   The CT plan will be documented in the unit training OI (T-3).
   6.3.2. TACTICS will be used for academic TACP CT requirements (see Chapter 7) (T-3).
   For those training areas not presently in TACTICS, Wing or Group approved training plans
   will be used until those areas appear in TACTICS (T-3). Each academic training task will
   require successful completion of an examination (80 percent minimum to pass) (T-3).
       6.3.2.1. Units must use TACTICS when the academic training module is available on the
       system with the exception of those modules that require Intelligence personnel to provide
       instruction (T-3). TACTICS training modules may be taught and tested in a group setting.
       Individuals test results and training will be documented in TACTICS by a unit Level 2
       User (T-3).
AFI13-113V1 14 JUNE 2012                                                                       25


        6.3.2.2. For modules which require Intelligence personnel to provide instruction.
        Intelligence personnel will document completed training in TACTICS as a Level 2 User
        (T-3).
    6.3.3. Unit commanders will decide if failure to complete all unit commander or higher
    headquarters (Wing/Group) CT requirements warrants the individual to be placed on N-CMR
    status (T-3). Commanders should base their decision on the number of requirements not
    completed, any training schedule adjustments/extensions done IAW paragraph 2.3, and
    impact on unit mission. Completion of Table 6.1(Ops) or Table 6.2 (Support) is mandated to
    maintain CMR status (T-3).
    6.3.4. 1C4X1 personnel filling JTAC positions are not required to use Table 6.1 as their CT
    table. 1C4X1 JTACs will comply with CT requirements of AFI 13-112, Volume 1, JTAC
    Training Program (T-3).
6.4. Regaining CMR Status. Commanders will recertify individuals IAW paragraph 5.4 (T-3).
6.5. Documentation. Completed training tasks for officer and enlisted, will be annotated on AF
Form 1098 (T-3). These documents will be kept in the individual’s TACP Training Folder or AF
Form 623 (T-3). AF Form 623 may be maintained in electronic or hardcopy format. If AF Form
1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, is not filed in the individual’s TACP
Training Folder or AF Form 623, a Memorandum for Record (MFR) will be inserted stating that
training completion information is available on TACTICS (T-3). TACP personnel will maintain
their MQT documentation, i.e. AF Form 1098s, until the initial CT requirements are completed
and documented (T-3).

                                           Chapter 8

      THEATER AIR CONTROL TRAINING INFORMATION COMPUTER SYSTEM

8.1. General. The Theater Air Control Training Information Computer System (TACTICS)
standardizes the MQT and CT training of the TACP community. TACTICS provides members
with global access to standardized, web-based training, and the ability to track this training.
TACTICS is on the Internet at http://www.tactics-training.com/.
   8.1.1. TACTICS provides the user with access to online courseware, and the ability to record
   courses and tests taken offline from the training tables. Users also have access to the Power
   Point® presentations associated with each course, including full course notes as well as all
   non-restricted references and a glossary of terms.
   8.1.2. Access into TACTICS is divided into four separate areas: Level II, Level II (read-
   only), Supervisor, and Student. Level II access is an administrative level for users that
   allows them to enter assigned personnel into the TACTICS system, download TACTICS
   training modules for classroom use, generate module tests, assign students specific modules
   and training tables, update training completion dates, enter test scores, decertify individual
   training items, and track unit/individual progress. Typically, the Level II users are the Unit
   Training Managers and JTAC-Is, but can include other unit personnel with a need-to-know
   determined by the unit Commander. Level II (read-only) allows personnel to view all reports
   and records of unit personnel in TACTICS without the ability to edit any records. Supervisor
   allows individuals listed as Supervisors in TACTICS to enroll their personnel into specific
   modules and training tables, enter task evaluation completion dates, and view training
   progress reports, training documents, and CAS Logs of their subordinates. Student is the
   standard user level that allows a member to view modules assigned to them, take tests and
   view their individual progress.
8.2. Training in TACTICS. Training in TACTICS is accomplished through units known as
modules. Each module is followed by a mandatory test and/or a criterion checklist, when
applicable. Test formats are either true-or-false, or multiple choice, and test questions are
randomly generated each time. TACTICS tests are designed to be taken in an open book format.
Visual cues give the learner immediate indication of which modules they have not attempted,
attempted and failed, or completed successfully.
   8.2.1. All user scores are stored and maintained, as well as the individual answers to each
   question, so a user may go back and review those questions they missed. If the person passes
   the test but has missed one or two questions, they will be allowed to review the correct
   responses and the associated references. Supervisors are notified via e-mail of a
   subordinate’s progress (pass/fail) through the training modules.
8.3. Responsibilities for TACTICS. The responsibilities for use of TACTICS are as follows:
   8.3.1. ACC/A3FC will:
        8.3.1.1. Be responsible for overall control and management of the TACTICS system.
        8.3.1.2. Grant, upon request, Level II access for TACTICS on a need-to-have basis.
        8.3.1.3. Provide direction and prioritization of module production.

     their profile information is correct.
     8.3.3.3. Upon permanent change of station (PCS), transfer personnel registered in the
     TACTICS departing the unit to their gaining unit.
     8.3.3.4. Track individual/unit training progress and report to the commander any
     negative trends.
     8.3.3.5. Use their chain of command to request any upgrades to Level II access.
     8.3.3.6. Contact technical support at techsupport@odysseyconsult.com, if problems
     operating TACTICS occur.
  8.3.4. Supervisors will (T-3):
     8.3.4.1. Ensure their personnel are utilizing TACTICS.
