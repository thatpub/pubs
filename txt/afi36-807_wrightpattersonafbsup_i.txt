This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements, by providing
guidance and procedures supervisors need to schedule civilian employees (except non-US citizen
employees employed outside the United States and the District of Columbia) for work and
holiday observances. It tells how to establish work schedules, rest and lunch periods, make ready
and clean-up time. It describes work subject to premium pay and shows how to get approval for
holiday work.

(WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) AFI 36-807, 21 June 1999, is supplemented as follows:

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) as paragraph 2.3, (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2.),
and authorizes MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation
commanders (para 3.3). Organization and tenant commanders establish by written order the daily
hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty, including uncommon
tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative workplace
arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective organizations (para
3.2). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2., 4.3., and 4.4 which had previously
been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a sample AWA
agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).
The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.

(WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) This revision updates organization and office symbol changes.
It also changes the Flexitime hours for the 88 ABW from 0630-1800 to 0600-1800 to coincide
with the other organizations listed.
1. Scope of Applicability. This instruction applies Air Force-wide, to appropriated fund
civilian employees, including US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard Title 5,
United States Code.
2. Terms and Definitions. The following terms and definitions are used in this instruction.
     2.1. Administrative Workweek. The Air Force administrative workweek begins at 0001
     Sunday and ends at 2400 on the next following Saturday. The calendar day on which a shift
     begins is considere Certified Current 17 February 2009 the day of duty for that day even
     though the day of duty extends into the next calendar day or into the following administrative
     workweek.
     2.2. Alternative Work Schedules (AWS). Work schedules made up of flexible or compressed
     schedules.
     2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement,
     either at home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See
     Attachment 2 for a sample agreement).
     2.4. Basic Workweek. The days and hours of an administrative workweek which make up a
     full-time employee's regularly scheduled 40-hour workweek.
     2.5. Compressed Schedule. Compressed schedule means for a full-time employee, an 80-
     hour biweekly basic work requirement which is scheduled in less than 10 workdays. In the
AFI36-807_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 24 JUNE 2010                                                      3


   case of a part-time employee, it is a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours
   which is scheduled for less than 10 workdays.
   2.6. First 40-Hours. The first 40 hours of duty performed within a period of no more than six
   days of the administrative workweek may be established as the basic workweek when it is
   impractical to prescribe a regular schedule of definite hours of duty each workday.
   2.7. Flexible Schedule. Flexible schedule is that portion of the work day during which the
   employee has the option to select and vary starting and stopping times within established
   limits set by installation level approving officials for AWS.
   2.8. Holiday Work. Work performed on a legal holiday or the day observed as a holiday.
   2.9. Observed Day. Observed day is a holiday in which employees are given time off on a
   day other than the date which the holiday actually falls on.
   2.10. Part Time. In some circumstances it is not possible to obtain or use an employee's
   services for the full 40-hour workweek. Part time tours of duty may be authorized when
   service on a regular, repetitive basis is required at least one day during each administrative
   workweek, however, additional service may be required during the remainder of the
   administrative workweek.
   2.11. Regular Tour of Duty. The regular tour of duty for Air Force employees is five 8-hour
   days, Monday through Friday.
   2.12. Special Tour of Duty for Educational Purposes. A special tour of duty of no less than
   40 hours in an administrative workweek which may be established by supervisors to permit
   employees to take courses at nearby educational institutions.
   2.13. Standby. Certain types of work require employees to remain at their duty stations for
   long periods of duty, a substantial part of which is standby time. For example, the tour of
   duty for firefighters generally is a 72-hour workweek of three 24-hour days. The tour is
   scheduled so that the employee is on duty three alternate 24-hour shifts during each
   administrative workweek, and deviations from this tour are kept to a minimum. The basic
   weekly tour of duty for fire chiefs, assistant fire chiefs, fire prevention inspectors, and similar
   fire protection personnel is 40-hour workweek of five 8-hour days unless the duties of the
   position require substantial amounts of standby time.
   2.14. Uncommon Tour of Duty. Any 40-hour basic workweek scheduled to include Saturday
   and or Sunday, for four workdays or less but not more than six days of the administrative
   workweek. An uncommon tour of duty may be established when necessary for efficient
   operations or when the cost of operations can thus be reduced without imposing undue
   hardship on employees.
3. Basic Authority:
   3.1. Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders establish the hours for opening and
   closing the installation.
   3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish
   by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of
   duty including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and
   location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods
4                             AFI36-807_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 24 JUNE 2010


    for their respective organizations. Organization and tenant commanders or their designated
    representative should set work schedules, assign overtime and holiday work to balance
    mission requirements, efficiency and economy of operations, and employee needs. These
    determinations are subject to approval by the installation commander or his or her designated
    representative who has authority for operation of base facilities. NOTE: organization/tenant
    commanders set the hours and locations for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs
    approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they delegate this authority to installation
    commanders as provided in 3.3
    3.2. (WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization
    commanders, tenant commanders, and two-letter equivalents in HQ AFMC and ASC will
    approve any uncommon tours of duty. Approval authorities will coordinate with 88
    FSS/FSMCZ prior to establishing such tours.              Organization commanders, tenant
    commanders, and two-letter equivalents in HQ AFMC and ASC will designate officials
    within their organizations to approve overtime and holiday work. Procedures for
    authorization of overtime and compensatory time are prescribed in DoD 7000.14-R, DoD
    Financial Management Regulation, Vol 8, para 020208. AF Form 428, Request for
    Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time, will be used to request
    authorization of overtime and compensatory time. Since overtime approval constitutes
    authority for the expenditure of funds and certification that overtime funds are available,
    approval must be obtained before the work is performed except in an emergency when it
    must be made a matter of record no later than the following workday.
       3.2.1. Organization and tenant commanders may also establish regularly scheduled tours
       of duty of more than 40 hours within the administrative workweek when such action is
       essential to mission accomplishment, and when other administrative action such as
       changes in authorized staffing or detail of personnel is neither feasible or desirable.
       Except under extraordinary circumstances, a tour of duty which includes regular overtime
       should not extend beyond 48 hours in an administrative workweek. Organization and
       tenant commanders may extend the regularly scheduled administrative workweek to any
       length exceeding 40 hours when emergency conditions exist and it is necessary for
       mission accomplishment. The extension of the tour of duty will be subject to the
       requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
       3.2.2. (Added-WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) Commanders and officials as referenced
       above who approve tours of duty must ensure that all appropriate union negotiation or
       consultation takes place concerning establishment of such duty tours, including changes
       to existing tours of duty, hours of work, and lunch or meal periods.
    3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major
    Commands (MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU)
    are authorized to approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may
    delegate this authority to installation commanders.
    3.3. (WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and
    Direct Reporting Units. Flexitime hours for participating HQ AFMC, ASC (to include 88
    ABW and 88 MDG), and AFRL organizations are established as follows:
       3.3.1. (Added-WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) Core Time: 0900-1500.
AFI36-807_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 24 JUNE 2010                                                 5


      3.3.2. (Added-WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) Flexible Time: 0600-1800. Note: Core
      time is that part of the day during which all employees must be present for work; flexible
      time is that part of the workday during which the employee has the option to select the
      starting and quitting times within the limits established by the employing agency. Lunch
      periods range from 30 minutes to 1 hour and will be taken between 1100 and 1300.
      Tenant organizations and others requiring clarification on specific flexitime plans should
      contact their organizations’ administrative offices.
   3.4. Supervisors. Supervisors will generally schedule employee's work on the same hours
   each day, and breaks in excess of one hour during a day will not be permitted. Supervisors
   must give a minimum of one week's notice to employees when they are to be assigned to a
   different tour of duty or to different hours of duty except as provided under AWS or for
   educational purposes.
      3.4.1. Commanders may grant an exception to this requirement when circumstances
      preclude compliance, for example, when a change in shifts by a contractor requires
      immediate corresponding change in the tour of inspectors, or when normal operations are
      interrupted by events beyond the control of management, such as, fire, flood, breakdown
      of equipment. Commanders assure that changes in established work schedules are kept to
      a minimum and made only when necessary to resolve operational problems.
4. Tours of Duty:
   4.1. Tours of Duty for Educational Purposes. Supervisors may establish special tours of duty
   for educational purposes.
      4.1.1. Employees who are on special tours of duty for educational purposes cannot be
      paid premium pay solely because the rescheduling of his or her tour of duty causes him or
      her to work on a day, or during the hours of a day, when premium pay would otherwise
      be required.
      4.1.2. Supervisors are not prohibited from assigning an employee to a regularly
      scheduled shift requiring premium pay, for example, night pay, since no additional costs
      are incurred. Supervisors must notify the civilian payroll office when an employee is
      assigned to or changed from a special tour of duty to prevent inadvertent payment of
      premium pay. Supervisors must maintain a record of these tours of duty for the purpose
      of responding to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) inquiries.
   4.2. Posting Work Schedules. Supervisors must post copies of work schedules for all tours of
   duty, except regular Monday through Friday tours, which include the names of assigned
   employees in the work area. Supervisors must maintain a copy of employee's work schedules
   in their operating office. Supervisors:
      4.2.1. Post a written statement of actual work requirements for standby tours of duty.
      4.2.2. Give employees with regularly scheduled 60 or 72 hour standby tours of duty 30
      calendar days notice of any reduction in the percentage of premium pay resulting from a
      change in work requirements.
      4.2.3. Give employees with regularly scheduled 40-hour tours of duty plus scheduled
      standby time as much notice as possible when changing their duty schedule.
6                             AFI36-807_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 24 JUNE 2010


       4.2.4. Review work requirements periodically for changes which may affect the payment
       of premium compensation and revise work schedules where necessary.
    4.3. Scheduling Rest Periods. Supervisors may schedule short rest periods, not exceeding 15
    minutes during each four hours of continuous work, when the supervisor believes the rest
    periods will be of benefit to the service. (NOTE: Supervisors must adhere to applicable labor
    management agreements if they contain provisions for the granting of rest periods.)
       4.3.1. Criteria to be followed by supervisors in determining the justification for granting
       rest periods are:
           4.3.1.1. Protection of employee's health by relieving them from hazardous work or
           very physical work.
           4.3.1.2. Reduce the accident rate by removing the fatigue potential.
           4.3.1.3. Relieve those who work in confined spaces.
           4.3.1.4. Increasing or maintaining a high quality or quantity production.
    4.4. Scheduling Lunch Periods. When supervisors schedule lunch (or other meal) periods,
    during which the employee is entirely free of the duties of his or her position, the period is
    not considered as duty time for which compensation is paid.
    4.4. (WRIGHTPATTERSONAFB) Scheduling Lunch Periods. Lunch or meal periods
    during which an employee is in a non-pay status will be a minimum of 30 minutes.
       4.4.1. Supervisors will generally schedule time for lunch apart from the hours of duty
       when one or two shifts are in operation.
       4.4.2. When supervisors schedule more than one 8-hour shift in a 24-hour period and an
       overlapping of shifts to permit time off for lunch is not possible, supervisors may
       authorize an on-the-job lunch period of 20 minutes or less. On-the-job lunch periods
       require that:
           4.4.2.1. Employees spend their on-the-job lunch at or near their work stations. Under
           these conditions, the time covered by the 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is
           compensable.
           4.4.2.2. Employees given duty free lunch periods during periods of overtime work
           will not receive compensation for that time.
    4.5. Scheduling Make Ready and Clean-Up Time. Incidental duties that are directly
    connected with the performance of a job, such as obtaining and replacing working tools or
    materials, undergoing inspections, and similar tasks are considered part of the job
    requirements within the employee's established tour of duty. Supervisors must arrange work
    shifts so that time required for incidental duties will be part of the 8-hour day.
       4.5.1. When incidental duties cannot be part of the regularly scheduled workday, the
       extra time for which overtime may be paid to an employee, will not exceed 30 minutes a
       day.
AFI36-807_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 24 JUNE 2010                                                  7


5. Holiday Observances:
   5.1. Holiday Duty. Supervisors must not require employees to work on holidays or days
   designated as observed days, unless the work is justified by unusual circumstances or if the
   maintenance of usual essential services is involved.
      5.1.1. Supervisors will order holiday work when required and have it approved in writing
      by an official designated to authorize holiday work. Supervisors must obtain this
      approval before work is performed, except in cases of an emergency, because it
      constitutes authority for expenditure of funds and certification that funds are available to
      pay the employee. Supervisors ordering work on a holiday or employees required to
      remain on duty during an emergency will not require advance approval for the work.
      Supervisors must record the reasons for the holiday and the hours worked by the
      employees no later than the following workday. This requirement does not apply to tours
      of duty regularly scheduled on a holiday or observed day for employees engaged in
      essential services such as firefighters, police, hospital employees, or other service
      personnel. The supervisor will record holiday work on an AF Form 428, Request for
      Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time.
   5.2. Observed Day. When a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled workday, observe that day
   as the holiday. If a holiday falls on Sunday and the employee has a regularly scheduled 40-
   hour basic workweek of Monday through Friday, the employee will observe the following
   Monday as the holiday. When the holiday falls on Saturday, the employee will observe the
   holiday on the proceeding Friday.
      5.2.1. When a holiday falls on a Sunday and that Sunday is a nonworkday for employees
      with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek of other than Monday through
      Friday, observe the next regularly scheduled workday as the holiday.
          5.2.1.1. When a holiday falls on the nonworkday designated as the day in-lieu-of
          Sunday, observe the next regularly scheduled workday as a holiday. When a holiday
          or a designated observed day falls on an employee's nonworkday (Monday through
          Saturday), the workday immediately preceding the day is observed as the holiday.
      5.2.2. Deleted
   5.3. Deleted
   5.4. When full-time employees on a compressed work schedule are relieved or prevented
   from working on a day designated as a holiday, they are entitled to basic pay for the number
   of hours of the compressed work schedule on that day.
   5.5. Holiday observances for employees who work a flexible schedule are the same as those
   for full-time employees with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek.
   5.6. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee's regularly scheduled workday, the
   employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is scheduled to
   work on the actual day of the holiday.
      5.6.1. If full-time employees observe an "in-lieu-of" day instead of the actual holiday and
      that "in-lieu-of" day falls within a part-time employee's work schedule, the part-time
      employee will not get that day off with pay.
8                              AFI36-807_WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBSUP_I 24 JUNE 2010


       5.6.2. When a holiday is observed by full-time employees on a day within the part-time
       employee's regularly scheduled workweek and the part-time employee is prevented from
       working that day, the employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours
       he or she is scheduled to work on that day.
       5.6.3. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee's nonworkday and is observed by
       full-time employees that day, the employee is not entitled to the holiday.
       5.6.4. When a part-time employee is on a flexible schedule and is relieved or prevented
       from working on a day designated as a holiday by a Federal statute or Executive Order
       (E.O.), the employee is entitled to receive basic pay for the number of hours the
       employee would have worked on that holiday up to eight hours.
       5.6.5. When a holiday falls on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu
       of" day for that holiday.
       5.6.6. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and is relieved or
       prevented from working on a day within the employee's scheduled tour of duty that is
       designated as a holiday by Federal statute or E.O., the employee is entitled to basic pay
       for the number of hours of the compressed work schedule on that day.
       5.6.7. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and a holiday falls
       on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu-of" day for that holiday.
    5.7. Duration of Holiday. The full 24-hours of a calendar day are normally considered as the
    duration of a holiday. However, when an employee's regular workday begins on a holiday
    and extends into the next calendar day, the entire shift is considered as a holiday to determine
    the employee's entitlement to holiday premium pay or time off for observance of the holiday.
    If an employee's regularly scheduled tour of duty includes two shifts beginning on a holiday,
    the first shift is considered as a holiday to determine holiday benefits.

               ALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTS (AWA)

A2.1. REASONS FOR AWA. Employers offer alternative workplace arrangements for many
reasons. Such arrangements may:
   A2.1.1. Improve the quality of work life and job performance and increases productivity,
   e.g., reduce office overcrowding and provide a distraction-free environment for reading,
   analyzing and writing;
   A2.1.2. Improve morale and reduces stress by giving employees more options to balance
   work and family demands;
   A2.1.3. Increase customer access to needed services;
   A2.1.4. Provide services when the regular office is closed;
   A2.1.5. Extend employment opportunities to people with disabilities, including employees
   who have partially recovered from work-related injuries who can do the job from an off-site
   location;
   A2.1.6. Accommodate employees who have temporary or continuing health problems or
   who might otherwise have to retire on disability;
   A2.1.7. Potentially enhance recruitment and promote diversity by expanding the geographic
   recruitment pool; and
   A2.1.8. Decrease traffic and parking congestion, energy consumption and air pollution.
A2.2. Organizations planning to use AWA should address issues such as the following: work
assignment/performance requirements, time and attendance, work schedule and tour of duty,
duty station, leave, equipment/supplies, labor relations issues, and other related work
arrangement requirements.
A2.3. Sample Agreement Between Organization, Supervisor, And Employee Approved For
An Alternative Workplace Arrangement On A Continuing Basis: The supervisor and
employee should each keep a copy of the agreement for reference.
Organization_______________________ Employee____________________________

Voluntary Participation. (Name)____________________________, the employee, voluntarily
agrees to work at the approved alternative workplace indicated below and to follow all applicable
work-related policies and procedures. The employee recognizes that the flexiplace arrangement
is not an employee benefit or entitlement, but an additional method the organization may
approve to accomplish work.

Trial Period. The employee and organization agree to try out the arrangement for at least
(specify number) months unless unforeseeable difficulties require earlier cancellation.

Salary and Benefits. Unless there is a change in the actual number of hours worked, a flexiplace
arrangement in itself is not a basis for changing the employee’s salary or benefits.

Leave. Employee agrees to follow established organization/office procedures for requesting and
obtaining approval of leave.

Overtime. Employee agrees to work overtime only when ordered and approved by the
supervisor in advance, and understands that working overtime without such approval may result

work place during the employee’s normal working hours to ensure proper maintenance of
Government-owned property and conformance with safety standards. (Organizations may require

responsible for any operating costs that are associated with the employee using his or her home
as an alternative worksite, e.g., home maintenance, insurance or utilities. The employee
understands he or she does not relinquish any entitlement to reimbursement for authorized
expenses incurred while conducting business for the Government, as provided for by statute and
regulations.

Injury Compensation. The employee understands that he or she is covered under the Federal
Employees Compensation Act if injured in the course of actually performing official duties at the
regular office or the alternative worksite. The employee agrees to notify the supervisor
immediately of any accident or injury that occurs at the alternative workplace and to complete
any required forms. The supervisor agrees to investigate such a report immediately.

the regular office after notice to the supervisor. Employee understands that the organization may
cancel the flexiplace arrangement and instruct the employee to resume working at the regular
office. The organization agrees to follow any applicable administrative or negotiated procedures.

Other Action. Nothing in this agreement precludes the organization from taking any appropriate
disciplinary or adverse action against an employee who fails to comply with the provisions of
this agreement.

                                       TEXT OF IC 99-1

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) as paragraph 2.3., (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2..),
and authorizes MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement
(AWA) programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation
commanders (para 3.3.). Organization and tenant commanders establish by written order the
daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty, including
uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative
workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective
organizations (para 3.2.). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2., 4.3., and 4.4.
which had previously been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a
sample AWA agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated
by a bar (|). The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.

2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement,
either at home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See Attachment 2
for a sample agreement).

3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish by
written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty
including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for
alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective
organizations. Organization and tenant commanders or their designated representative should set
work schedules, assign overtime and holiday work to balance mission requirements, efficiency
and economy of operations, and employee needs. These determinations are subject to approval
by the installation commander or his or her designated representative who has authority for
operation of base facilities. NOTE: organization/tenant commanders set the hours and locations
for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they
delegate this authority to installation commanders as provided in 3.3.

3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major Commands
(MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are authorized
to approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority
