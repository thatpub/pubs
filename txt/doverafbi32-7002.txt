This instruction supplements AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality. This instruction establishes
base policy and assigns responsibility for wastewater system oversight and operation. The
instruction applies to domestic wastewater treatment facilities including but not limited to
collection systems, lift stations, septic tanks, primary, secondary, and tertiary wastewater
treatment processes; non-domestic waste pretreatment and treatment facilities including but not
limited to stormwater, industrial waste streams, oil/water separators, grease traps, and leachate
control facilities; and wastewater discharges to collection systems and injection wells. Emphasis
will be placed on controlling non-domestic wastewater. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained In Accordance With (IAW) Air

1. Purpose. An effective base program for controlling wastewater collection, treatment, and
disposal requires the full support and cooperation of activities that generate wastewater. This
instruction:
     1.1. Outlines interaction with various base environmental plans.
     1.2. Outlines a scoping process for identifying and characterizing waste from point sources
     on base and implementing a waste minimization, control, and treatment program to reduce
     and prevent pollution.
     1.3. Prescribes collection, segregation, and disposal procedures for special waste and
     treatment or pretreatment of domestic and non-domestic waste.
     1.4. Outlines procedures for monitoring, testing, and reporting to regulatory agencies.
     1.5. Designates offices of primary responsibility for various tasks.
2. Scope:
     2.1. This instruction is consistent with and augments the following base plans:
        2.1.1. Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Prevention and Response Plan, DAFB OPlan
        32-7
        2.1.2. Hazardous Waste and Used Petroleum Management Plan, DAFB OPlan 32-3
     2.2. This instruction is consistent with and augments the following Civil Engineering
     Operational plans:
        2.2.1. Oil/Water Separator Management Plan
        2.2.2. Storm water Pollution Prevention Plan
3. Policy: Base policy is as follows:
     3.1. Comply with Federal, interstate, state, and local requirements pertaining to permitting,
     managing, treating, and discharging of wastewater. The above requirements take precedence
     if they conflict with this instruction. Assure timely submission of monitoring reports and
     reply to correspondence from regulatory agencies to avoid regulatory noncompliance and to
     maintain good working relations with the regulatory community.
     3.2. Ensure and implement BMPs for collection of wastewater and operation of wastewater
     treatment systems. Eliminate unpermitted discharges and cross-connections between
     wastewater and storm water collection systems.

   3.3. Consider the long-term risk to the human and natural environment when making
   wastewater management decisions to include environmental impact analysis and life cycle
   management costs.
   3.4. Minimize the treatment of wastewater, using wastewater characterization to determine
   the level of treatment needed for each waste generation point.
   3.5. Develop consistent base-wide approaches to wastewater management which apply to all
   base and tenant organizations.
   3.6. Enforce wastewater discharge policies through use of source monitoring, shop surveys,
   and administrative action to prevent treatment system interruptions and discharge violations.
   3.7. Use prudent inspection, operation, and preventive maintenance practices to maximize
   treatment effectiveness, minimize costs and eliminate noncompliance of discharge
   limitations.
   3.8. Utilize waste minimization source reduction techniques and wastewater pretreatment at
   or near the waste generation point to the extent needed to protect collection, treatment, and
   disposal facilities and processes from damage, upset, excessive cost, or discharge violations.
   Where feasible, source waste reduction through material substitution, process change and/or
   administrative change shall be preferred over pretreatment.
   3.9. Utilize BMPs and accepted engineering approaches at the waste generation point to
   eliminate pollutant slug-loading at the wastewater treatment plant.
   3.10. Utilize Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) services for regional or municipal
   wastewater treatment where practical and to the advantage of the government.
