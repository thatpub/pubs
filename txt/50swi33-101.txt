This publication implements Air Force Technical Manual 00-33A-1001, General
Communications Activities Management Procedures and Practice Requirements. This
document provides guidance for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) on resolving
outage conditions. It addresses specific resolution procedures required to troubleshoot, restore,
and properly manage the Operational Switch Replacement (OSR) that encompasses all AFSCN
communications. It applies to all AFSCN tenant organizations, Schriever AFB (SAFB), Remote
Tracking Stations (RTS) and other Remote Ground Facilities (RGF), AFSCN External Users
(EXU), and all contractors tasked by this instruction, as stipulated by contract.
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes incorporated into this document include: moving the second paragraph of the summary
to the overview; removing any references to specific carrier agencies, equipment models, and
communications types; adding the use of the Schriever Conference Bridge and direction thereof;
adding references to 50SWI10-224, AFSCN Outage Reporting System; updating work centers
and contact numbers; and correcting minor spelling errors and some language usage.

1. Overview.
     1.1. The 22nd Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS) is responsible for overall AFSCN
     operations. The 50th Space Communications Squadron (50 SCS) is responsible for the
     overall operations and maintenance of the AFSCN communication segment. The 50 SCS
     will be responsible for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the SAFB Operational
     Control Node (OCN) as well as fault detection/fault isolation (FD/FI) of those resources.
     The Onizuka Network Operations Flight (OAFS) (21 SOPS/DON), as delegated by the 50
     SCS, is responsible for operations and maintenance of OAFS OCN and FD/FI of all AFSCN
     communication outages that affects both OCNs.
     1.2. OSR is a dynamic communication environment that uses inter-dependent and redundant
     communications systems and links. Due to this network implementation, user coordination
     for FD/FI and fault recovery activities between the OCNs and Remote Ground Facilities
     (RGF) is of paramount importance. As with previous AFSCN communications systems, the
     primary source for identifying anomalies is the user. The OSR Distributed Communications
     Controller (DCC) will identify problems and indicate communication system problems,
     notably failure to establish connections.
     1.3. What may have been an appropriate action in the past can be problematic in OSR. OSR
     network implementation has built-in redundancy and depending on the problem detected, it
     may still be providing full operational capabilities, despite fault indications. Immediate
     action may not always be warranted.
2. Organizations.
     2.1. The various agencies, facilities and work centers involved in outage resolution are
     described in Table 2.1.
     2.2. Many agencies and work centers coordinate efforts on shared voice nets or voice
     conferences. Call-signs are used to help distinguish between organizations on a net. The
     organizational descriptions in Table 2.1 include call signs used by those agencies.

3. Coordination Procedures.
   3.1. To ensure all actions that could affect AFSCN communications are properly
   coordinated, there are specific coordination procedures that must be followed. These
   coordination procedures are included in Attachment 1.
Note: Many coordination procedures are used during the resolution of communication outages,
but some coordination procedures will occur on a regular basis as a part of preventative
maintenance, scheduled downtimes, and crypto operations. These coordination procedures must
be followed to prevent any communication outages.
   3.2. All coordination procedures follow these basic precepts:
       3.2.1. Any action that will affect the normal operation of OSR communication
       equipment requires prior coordination with 22 SOPS, 50 SCS, and 21 SOPS/DON.
       3.2.2. All those involved in an OSR communication effort will meet on the OSR Tech
       Net before taking any action.
          3.2.2.1. Should the OSR Tech Net be unavailable, all parties will make all efforts to
          coordinate with the applicable parties through whatever means are available.
       3.2.3. Should any anomaly or outage condition occur during a routine crypto operation,
       administrative change, or maintenance effort, all further actions will be suspended while
       50 SCS and 21 SOPS/DON investigate.
4. OSR Tech Net.
   4.1. The OSR Tech Net is conference that facilitates coordination between agencies while
   troubleshooting is in progress. It is established on both the SAFB Conference Bridge and on
   the OAFS TCSS (Traffic Control Switching Set).
       4.1.1. 50 SCS will maintain a conference dedicated to the OSR Tech Net on the SAFB
       Conference Bridge.
 4                                                          50SWI33-101 19 AUGUST 2010


        4.1.2. 21 SOPS Voice Operations will maintain a voice net dedicated to the OSR Tech
        Net on the TCSS.
        4.1.3. 21 SOPS Network Director (Comm Control) will maintain an active connection
        between the dedicated TCSS voice net at OAFS and the dedicated SAFB conference for
        the OSR Tech Net.
     4.2. 50 SCS and 21 SOPS/DON will request AFSCN users and communication work centers
     to join the OSR Tech Net as needed to aid troubleshooting efforts.
     4.3. Comm Control will continuously monitor the TCSS voice net connected with the SAFB
     Conference Bridge and will oversee and assist any coordination efforts.
     4.4. OAFS communication work centers have direct access to the OSR Tech Net via TCSS
     phones. When needed, Comm Control will contact the work center to have the area access
     the OSR Tech Net.
     4.5. The RTS communication areas can access the OSR Tech Net via the TCSS operator or
     by dialing direct into the SAFB Conference Bridge.
     4.6. All others agencies and work centers can access the OSR Tech Net by dialing directly
     into the SAFB Conference Bridge at CMCL (719) 567-1117 or DSN 560-1117, and entering
     the conference with 2666# (C-O-M-M-#), or by contacting the TCSS operator at CMCL
     (408) 7523661 or DSN 5613661, and providing a call back number to be added to the TCSS
     voice net.
        4.6.1. Should Comm Control not be readily available on the OSR Tech Net, immediately
        contact Comm Control directly at CMCL (408) 752-3331 or DSN 561-3331.
     4.7. The TCSS operator may contact agencies and work centers to add them to the OSR
     Tech Net upon the request of other parties already on the OSR Tech Net.
Note: Call signs are used on the OSR Tech Net to distinguish between agencies and work
centers communicating on the net. (see Table 2.1)
