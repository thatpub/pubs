     pyramid evaluations, unless requested by HQ AMC/A3V with prior coordination of
     AFRC/A3V. Units without MDS representation at HQ AMC/A3V do not receive HQ
     AMC/A3V flight evaluations unless directed by HQ AMC/A3. When HQ AMC flight
     examiners are not available to administer pyramid evaluations to AMC-gained AFRC
     evaluators, HQ AFRC/A3V (primary) or HQ AFRC NAF/A3V (secondary) will provide
     a flight examiner for the evaluation prior to a wing level flight examiner being scheduled
     to administer the evaluation.
        2.4.2.6.1. (Added-AMC) If there are no specific aircrew or aircraft representation at
        the pyramid level, then the next higher level is responsible. The senior evaluators for
        specific aircraft and missions receive evaluations from any appropriately qualified
        examiners when there are no qualified examiners in the pyramid above them.
        2.4.2.6.2. (Added-AMC) When a HQ AMC examiner is not available to perform a
        pyramid evaluation, examiner’s will annotate in the remarks section of the AF Form 8
        that the evaluation satisfies the requirement of the pyramid evaluation per prior
        coordination with HQ AMC A3V. Include the HQ AMC evaluator’s name. For
        AFRC crewmembers the statement should also include HQ AFRC/3V coordination
        i.e. per coordination with HQ AMC/A3V, (Rank and Name) and HQ AFRC/A3V
        (Rank and Name) this evaluation satisfies the requirement for a pyramid evaluation.
     Exception: Pyramid evaluation is not required for aircrew undergoing aircraft conversion,
     difference training on aircraft or for students completing formal qualification and
     training programs according to AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1.

       examiners are not required to maintain special mission currency according to AFI 11-
       202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training, and the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1;
       but they should have initial qualification in the specific special mission and participate as
       an examiner or observer on at least one special mission every 6-months.
   2.4.4. Augmentation. Each NAF may use qualified augmentees from other NAFs to
   support or conduct stan/eval aircrew evaluations and inspections with concurrence of all the
   NAF stan/eval organizations involved.
2.5. Stan/Eval Visits. HHQ stan/eval staffs may visit units during the administration of formal
inspections, Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) or in an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM
supplements.
   2.5.1. (Added-AMC) Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Visit (ASEV):
       2.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Purpose. ASEVs are the principal tool for evaluating aircrew
       flight operations and verifying safe and effective mission accomplishment. This is
       achieved through aircrew testing and flight evaluations to ensure compliance with
       approved operational procedures and applicable special interest items. Additionally, the
       effectiveness of unit aircrew Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and Aviation Resource
       Management programs are evaluated to ensure compliance and standardization among
       flying units, and provide meaningful feedback to unit commanders.
          2.5.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC ASEV teams may request augmentation from
          units or user-commands. The HQ AFRC NAF/A3Vs should augment teams for
          ASEV on their respective AFRC units, and may be asked to augment any ASEV
          team. AFRC augmentee support will be coordinated through HQ AFRC/A3V.
       2.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) ASEV Testing. ASEV team will administer a closed book
       examination to all available personnel, in the grade of O-5 and below, who are qualified
       to fly unsupervised in unit aircraft. All aircrew attached at the wing or below will test.
       Test individuals who are dual MDS aircraft qualified in only their primary aircraft. The
       ASEV examinations may be used to satisfy recurring closed book testing requirements
       for flight evaluations.
          2.5.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Tests will be derived from a minimum of 85%
          MQF questions, with the balance coming from Flight Publications,
          Safety/Operational Supplements, FCIFs, and local directives.
          2.5.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) ASEV tests have minimum passing scores according to
          requirements for closed book examinations in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Crewmembers
          failing ASEV closed book tests will be placed in supervised status until successful
          completion of unit closed book exams.
              2.5.1.2.2.1. (Added-AMC) The ASEV team will report the names of individuals
              tested and their scores to the unit commander. The final ASEV report will list the
              average of test scores by crew position and the overall average test score.
              2.5.1.2.2.2. (Added-AMC) The ASEV team chief may elect to send the ASEV
              test after formal ASEV notification but before arrival of the ASEV team. In this
              case, the unit will identify a ―trusted agent‖ to control the ASEV test content and
              conduct unit testing, or as specified by ASEV team chief.

     2.5.1.3. (Added-AMC) Primary ASEV Flight Evaluations. HQ AMC flight examiners
     will administer in-flight evaluations to senior OG (or equivalent) Stan/Eval personnel for
     each of the unit's assigned mission or design aircraft.
        2.5.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) Do not extend the senior Stan/Eval crewmember's
        evaluation expiration date to allow evaluation during the ASEV.
        2.5.1.3.2. (Added-AMC) If any senior Stan/Eval crewmembers are scheduled to
        change within 3 months following ASEV, administer evaluations to designated
        replacements.
        2.5.1.3.3. (Added-AMC) Pyramid evaluations received within 6 months before the
        start of an ASEV will count towards the ASEV in-flight evaluation requirements.
        2.5.1.3.4. (Added-AMC) ASEV Simulator Evaluations. HQ AMC flight examiners
        may evaluate crew members in the applicable training device (if available). The
        evaluation will include all activity required for a Simulator evaluation.
        2.5.1.3.5. (Added-AMC) For KC-10 senior boom operator, use Boom Operator
        Trainer (SIM/BOT). In addition, a KC-10 CCTS instructor crew will be administered
        a SIM/BOT evaluation. Credit each SIM/BOT evaluation for one flight evaluation.
     2.5.1.4. (Added-AMC) Secondary ASEV Flight Evaluations:
        2.5.1.4.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC flight examiners will administer flight
        evaluations to instructors (preferably performing instructor duties) or flight examiners
        (preferably performing flight examiner or instructor duties). Additionally, ASEV
        team members may administer evaluations to any crewmember that is current and
        qualified to fly in unit aircraft and is on the flying schedule. Complete an AF Form 8,
        Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, for all ASEV evaluations. The total number of
        evaluations will be at the discretion of the ASEV team chief.
        2.5.1.4.2. (Added-AMC) Credit may be taken for ASEV evaluations on local and
        off-station SPOT evaluations administered by HQ AMC flight examiners on AMC-
        directed deployment, re-deployment, airlift, AR, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability
        Training (JA/ATT), JOSAC, operational and local training missions within 90 days of
        the designated start date of the ASEV. OG/CC approval is required when conducting
        local or JA/ATT evaluations before the scheduled ASEV for ANG and AFRC
        mobility units.
     2.5.1.5. (Added-AMC) ASEV Requirements:
        2.5.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) ASEV Scheduling/Notification. AMC ASEV teams will
        normally visit units approximately every 40 months for unit-equipped active duty
        units and approximately every 60 months for unit-equipped ANG and AFRC units.
        Associate unit (active duty and ARC) visits will be the same frequency (and usually
        concurrent) with their unit-equipped host unit. Official unit ASEV notification will be
        sent to the unit not less than 90 days prior to the scheduled visit. The notification
        message will include ASEV team composition, transportation requirements, special
        interest items, and other details of the visit. Initial planning dates for unit ASEVs are
        coordinated with AFRC and NGB IG and A3V counterparts, and are published semi-
        annually in the AMC/IG Command-Wide Inspection Schedule and posted on the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                     17


        AMC/A3V website. Unit scheduling conflicts should be reported to HQ AMC/A3VS
        for resolution; all changes will be coordinated with the respective MAJCOM, with
        final approval by HQ AMC/A3
        2.5.1.5.2. (Added-AMC) Flight evaluations should represent a cross section of the
        unit's operational mission. Instructors may be asked to demonstrate maneuvers to help
        assess instructor ability. All crewmembers (to include AECM where applicable) may
        be asked to accomplish specific tasks or maneuvers for their crew qualification to
        assess proficiency. ASEV flight evaluations may be administered up to and including
        90 days prior to the beginning of the ASEV.
        2.5.1.5.3. (Added-AMC) ASEV teams will complete all AF IMTs 8 for in-flight
        evaluations before departure. At the unit commander’s discretion, and with ASEV
        evaluator’s approval, evaluations administered by ASEV flight examiners may be
        credited toward periodic evaluation requirements. This request must be made prior to
        the start of the evaluation. Complete remaining ground items within 2 months (AFRC
        and ANG units may use entire eligibility period for the accomplishment of requisites)
        but not later than the end of the eligibility period. For evaluations graded Q-3 refers to
        paragraph 5.2.7.3.2.
     2.5.1.6. (Added-AMC) ASEV Grading. A unit-level overall ASEV grade will be
     awarded. At the conclusion of the visit, the ASEV team chief will provide feedback (oral
     or written) to the unit commander and staff. In addition, HQ AMC/A3 or designated
     representative will release an ASEV written report following review/endorsement. ASEV
     teams will identify those areas not in compliance with current guidelines and include as
     ―required improvements‖. Units will report corrective action to AMC/A3V within 90
     days after receiving the final report. This report will be in the form of an official
     memorandum signed by the unit’s operations group commander to HQ AMC/A3V. It
     will provide specifics on what corrective action was taken to resolve each of the
     ―required improvements‖ to bring each of the designated areas into compliance.
     2.5.1.7. (Added-AMC) ASEV Programs. All unit Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, and
     Aircrew Resource Management System programs are subject to inspection. The
     AMC/A3V ASEV Standards Guide provides additional information and guidance on
     specific programs subject to assessment by the ASEV team. Individual programs will be
     awarded a grade using the following scale:
        2.5.1.7.1. (Added-AMC) Outstanding: Program exceeds all requirements with no
        significant discrepancies.
        2.5.1.7.2. (Added-AMC) Excellent: Program exceeds most requirements with few
        deviations noted.
        2.5.1.7.3. (Added-AMC) Satisfactory: Program meets requirements with some

     2.5.1.8. (Added-AMC) ASEV Results. Approved unit ASEV Reports are posted on HQ
     AMC/ A3V website.
  2.5.2. (Added-AMC) Staff Assistance Visits.
     2.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V (AFRC/A3V for AFRC Units) will conduct
     scheduled Mid Term ASEV Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) at the approximate half-way
     point between ASEVs. Notification of the SAV will be sent to the unit approximately 45
     days prior. SAVs may include any Stan/Eval or training related area the unit requests.
     2.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) AMC/A3V will normally not conduct a SAV in the 6 month
     period prior to a stan/eval inspection.
     2.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) Reports generated by a SAV will be informal (internal use
     only). Results from AFRC SAVs administered IAW paragraph 2.5.2.1 (Added) will be
     briefed to the AFRC A3 and forwarded to HQ AMC/A3V.
  2.5.3. (Added-AMC) Informal Visits. For AMC evaluators visiting AMC units, prior
  coordination for an informal visit is not required. Informal visits to AFRC units other than to
  administer a pyramid evaluation will be coordinated through AFRC A3V. AFRC NAF
  evaluators may perform informal visits within their NAFs with NAF A3 approval. If the
  purpose of visit is other than continuation training or pyramid evals, HHQ evaluators will
  informally in/out-brief with the OG/CC. Reports, if generated, will be informal (for internal
  use only).

        3.2.2.4.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.4.1. (AMC) Include the following areas in trend analysis (if available):
        open/closed book examination program, evaluations, supplementary evaluation
        program, supervisory observations, and ATS contractor feedback.
        3.2.2.4.2. For units with more than one type of aircraft, combine discrepancies
        common to all aircraft/aircrews to determine trends (e.g., instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.4.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs)/Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and qualified/instructor aircrews.
        3.2.2.4.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR); report trends and status to the
        OG/CC during the SEB until closed. OGV will publish and define the trend program
        in the unit supplement to this instruction and maintain trend data for at least one year.

        (4AF or 22AF) quarterly (AFRC and ANG units semi-annually) in SEB minutes.
        3.2.2.4.5. (Added-302AW) The trend program will be managed by OG/OGV. After
        each calendar semi-annual period OG/OGV will use Patriot Excalibur (PEX) to
        analyze requisite examinations and flight evaluations for trends. Additional sources
        for trends include supplementary evaluations and supervisor observations.
            3.2.2.4.5.1. (Added-302AW) Requisite examinations administered by 302 OG
            during the semi-annual period will be analyzed for missed questions from the
            testing databases. Questions will constitute a negative trend when missed more
            than 25% of the time using a minimum sample size of ten. Analysis will also
            include combining questions that address common areas or systems.
            3.2.2.4.5.2. (Added-302AW) Areas graded Q- or U on 302 OG administered
            evaluations will constitute a negative trend when occurring more than 25% of the
            time using a minimum sample size of ten. Areas identified as commendable on
            302 OG administered evaluations will constitute a positive trend when occurring
            more than 25% of the time using a minimum sample size of ten.
            3.2.2.4.5.3. (Added-302AW) Supplementary evaluations resulting in negative
            (or positive) behavior occurring more than 25% of the time will be identified as a
            trend.
            3.2.2.4.5.4. (Added-302AW) Supervisory observations will be solicited from
            commanders, senior evaluators, and section supervisors for reporting as trends.

   the squadron level is at the SQ/CCs discretion, but should be sufficient to maintain the unit’s
   qualification during times of deployment.
3.4. (Added-302AW) Pyramid evaluations within the 302 AW will be conducted IAW Figure
3.1. The OG/CC may designate a secondary senior evaluator from any evaluator within the
group to conduct pyramid evaluations in the senior OG/OGV evaluator’s absence. Squadron
flight examiners, including the senior squadron evaluator, will not administer flight evaluations
for aircrew members from another squadron without prior approval of the examinee’s SQ/CC.

                                          Chapter 4

                                   FLIGHT EXAMINERS

4.1. General. The evaluation portion of the Aircrew Stan/Eval Program is administered by
flight examiners at both the HHQ and unit levels.
4.2. Selection.
   4.2.1. Select Flight Examiners from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors.
   EXCEPTION: Senior flight examiners are selected IAW paragraph 4.2.3.
   4.2.2. The chief of the respective MAJCOM or NAF stan/eval function will select HHQ
   flight examiners. EXCEPTION: Senior flight examiners are selected IAW paragraph 4.2.3.
   4.2.3. Senior flight examiner eligibility is defined as flying commanders at the NAF and OG
   levels. Vice commanders (NAF/CV) may perform this function if the principal incumbent is
   not qualified or not available. This eligibility includes deputy commanders at the OG level
   (OG/CD) in multi-MDS wings where the OG/CC and the OG/CD fly different aircraft. In
   single-MDS wings, deputies may perform this function if the principal incumbent is not
   qualified or not available.
   4.2.4. The OG/CC will select, and designate in writing, all OGV flight examiners. Selection
   and designation will be annotated in the unit certification document, recorded in ARMS and
   reported in SEB minutes (Attachment 2).
   4.2.4. (302AW) The 302 OG/CC will select flight examiners to be the senior OG/OGV
   evaluator and designate a secondary senior evaluator for each crew position that can
   administer pyramid evaluations in the absence of the senior OG/OGV evaluator.
   4.2.5. The squadron commander will select, and designate in writing, squadron flight
   examiners. Selection and designation will be annotated in the unit certification document,
   recorded in ARMS and reported in SEB minutes (Attachment 2).
   4.2.5. (AMC) Unit certification document is Letter of X’s replacing the use of 1381/4348s.
   The Letter of X’s is populated by signed AF IMT 4324s. See attachment for sample letter of
   X’s.
   4.2.5. (302AW) The need for squadron flight examiners should be identified via the R & C
   process. SQ/CCs should select flight examiners via the OG training review panel (TRP)
   process or via a SQ training review board (TRB). Crewmembers approved for upgrade will
   complete the squadron training program (IAW AFI 11-2C-130V1 section 5.5. or AFI 11-
   2AEV1 section 5.9.) and be certified by the SQ/CC via the R & C process.
   4.2.6. For AFRC and ANG units:
       4.2.6.1. The Air Force advisor may be designated as a flight examiner.
       4.2.6.2. Air Technician (AT)/Air Reserve Technician (ART) /Active Guard and Reserve
       (AGR) serving in a military position that does not require maintaining mission
       ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as a flight examiner.
 34                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


      4.2.6.3. (Added-AMC) For AFRC and ANG units, one alternate flight examiner may be
      designated to administer flight evaluations in the absence of the senior evaluator.
      4.2.6.4. (Added-AMC) Associate units establish an OG Stan/Eval under the OG/CC or
      equivalent. The duties and responsibilities associated with Host Wing OG Stan/Eval
      apply except the Host OGV manages common areas for both Host and Associate Wings
      or Squadrons, e.g., Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB), and
      requisite examinations. This does not preclude the Associate OGV from managing
      Associate unit-unique FCIFs or developing examinations to meet unit requirements.
      4.2.6.5. (Added-AMC) All Air Technician/Active Guard Reserve (AT/AGR) and Air
      Reserve Technicians (ART) may be flight examiner qualified. ART personnel should
      occupy senior evaluator positions. For all aircrew positions, when a non-technician fills a
      Stan/Eval Unit Manning Document (UMD) position, units may assign a technician in that
      crew position to the Stan/Eval division. In this case, the technician will assume the duties
      of the senior evaluator for that crew position and may administer all evaluations.
      4.2.6.6. (Added-AMC) AFRC OG flight examiners may evaluate aircrew counterparts
      in both their OG and host active duty OG.
4.3. Functions. Flight Examiners:
   4.3.1. Conduct flight and EP evaluations as required.
   4.3.2. Maintain qualification as instructors. EXCEPTION: Not required for senior flight
   examiners.
   4.3.3. Maintain MR/CMR status as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1 AFIs,
   MDS XX - Aircrew Training. EXCEPTIONS: FTU, HHQ, senior flight examiners, and
   HHQ-designated test/evaluation units must maintain at least Basic Mission Capable (BMC)
   status.
   4.3.4. Administer evaluations only within their aircrew specialty/weapon system and will
   only evaluate those missions in which they maintain qualification. EXCEPTION: SPOT
   evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2.
   MAJCOMs may establish procedures for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside
   of NAF/unit.
   4.3.4. (AMC) Unit-level flight examiners will only administer SPOT evaluations within
   their respective MDS and crew position unless directed by OG/CC.
   4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
   and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
   (this applies to all aircrew members). If this situation occurs, the flight examiner will also
   debrief unit supervision, as designated in the unit supplement, and if appropriate, document
   the deviation on an AF Form 8/8a.
      4.3.6.1. (Added-AMC) The flight examiner normally does not assume the examinee's
      position for unsatisfactory performance. If warranted, the flight examiner may assume the
      duties of that crew member, if current and qualified. Advise the crew and assume full
      responsibility for the crew position for the rest of the mission leg. In the mobility system,
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                   35


      evaluators will notify the mission execution authority immediately and coordinate follow-
      on action (replacement, if required). The evaluator should be prepared to continue follow-
      on missions if directed by the execution authority.
      4.3.6.2. (Added-AMC) If, in the examiner's judgment, the examinee can continue safely
      (under supervision) the flight examiner should not assume the examinee's duties.
      4.3.6.3. (Added-AMC) Flight examiners performing in-flight duties and not qualified
      and current for the crew position in which unsatisfactory performance is observed (non-
      specialty) will inform the aircraft commander immediately.
   4.3.7. Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and flight
   commander whenever Qualification Level 2 or 3 (―Q-2‖ or ―Q-3‖) performance is observed.
   4.3.7. (AMC) When a flight examiner observes less than Qualification Level ―Q-1‖
   performance from any crew-member not being evaluated, the flight examiner will consult
   with appropriate qualified personnel and (through the Chief, OGV) will complete a follow-on
   recommendation for appropriate action to the unit commander (e.g., commander directed
   downgrade, follow-on N/N evaluation, additional training, etc.). The unit commander will
   determine the final course-of-action in accordance with ―commander-directed downgrade‖
   procedures.
   4.3.8. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
   requested by the MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
   MAJCOM stan/eval organization of the examiner.
   4.3.8. (AMC) Active duty and Reserve OG/OGV flight examiners may evaluate aircrew
   counterparts in both their OG and their Associate OG. Squadron or Detachment Flight
   examiners may administer evaluations outside their unit, with the approval of the examinee's
   squadron commander.
   4.3.9. (Added-AMC) Formal Training Units (FTU)/CCTS evaluators may evaluate AMC
   and AMC-gained aircrew members at formal schools or as augmentees to ASEVs.
   4.3.10. (Added-AMC) For en route evaluations, flight examiner pilots may, at their
   discretion, serve as an augmented crewmember during evaluations, but should not occupy a
   pilot seat for takeoff and landing.
4.4. Senior Flight Examiner Program.
   4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary
   assigned aircraft. Vice commanders and deputies may perform this function if the principal
   incumbent is not qualified or available.
   4.4.2. NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and OG/CDs that fly different aircraft from the OG/CC in multi-
   MDS wings, do not require, nor do they have to maintain, instructor certification or
   MR/CMR status. To become a flight examiner, NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and applicable OG/CDs,
   must maintain BMC status and be flight examiner certified. For other than SPOT evaluations,
   Senior Flight Examiners will evaluate only events for which they are current and at a level
   for which they are qualified.
4.5. Aircrew positions that do not require a flight phase evaluation do not require flight
examiners.

                                           Chapter 5

                                       EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification
evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8/8a to ensure
aircrew qualification. EPEs are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations.
Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure
standardization of flying and other operations.
5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two
structured phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The
ground phase, when required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an
inflight or, if applicable, simulator evaluation of aircrew performance. EXCEPTION: For
specialized aircrew qualified IAW Universal Qualification guidance see paragraph 5.2.18.
   5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are five types of aircrew
   qualification evaluations. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are administered to
   ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member (QUAL),
   qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM, when applicable)
   and qualification to employ the MDS of the aircrew member in accomplishing the unit’s
   operational mission (MSN). Evaluations are accomplished to ensure aircrew are certified and
   maintain instructor qualification (INSTR). Evaluation and certification of specific aircrew
   performance may also be accomplished (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types
   of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
       5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in
       their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI
       11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
       5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations. All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally
       with the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualification.
       EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI 11-401,
       Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft pilots;
       USAFA T-41 and T-51 pilots. Note: Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be
       assigned to other aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification in
       non-excepted aircraft. To obtain/maintain instrument qualification, pilots must
       successfully complete a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under
           his/her command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke
           an instrument qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the
           procedures in Chapter 7 for a commander-directed downgrade.
           5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as a
           pilot in aircraft in which instrument qualification is required except in a training
           program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in supervised
           status. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed in paragraph 5.2.1.2).
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                      37


     5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
     aircrew status will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft,
     to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the
     performance of normal operational and training sorties. The requirement for a MSN
     evaluation may be waived for those aircraft where performance of normal operational,
     test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM
     and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. QUAL and
     MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. Aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in a
     particular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional
     capability in that MDS aircraft. Specialized qualified, universally qualified, or multiple
     qualified aircrew maintaining instructor qualification in multiple similar aircraft will
     accomplish initial and periodic evaluations as specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
        5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the aircrew
        member must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation.
        Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever
        possible. When students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator may
        serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
        5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be
        conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description for these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as
        the AF Form 8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest
        qualification demonstrated during the previous evaluation (e.g. IB, IN, IP).
        5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained
        through an instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2 and
        5.2.3.2.4) as directed in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1.
        5.2.1.4.4. (Added-AMC) The flight evaluator will determine the evaluatee's seat
        position (normally right seat) for the initial instructor pilot evaluation and will include
        a minimum of one approach and landing.
     5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an
     evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g., INSTM,
     QUAL, MSN or INSTR). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements,
     unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as a SPOT
     evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all
     required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval and the examinee
     subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the
     periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the
     requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs
     with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves
     the additional flight time requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 -
38                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


     5.2.1.4 will be documented as SPOT evaluations. NOTE: When the flight examiner
     administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the MDS and same crew position of
     the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.1.5. (AMC) SPOT Evaluations. Examinee must receive notification before entering
     pre-mission or pre-departure crew rest. The unit's (90-day prior) ASEV notification
     message satisfies this requirement. Crewmembers should not receive more than one
     SPOT evaluation per calendar year. EXCEPTION: As directed by the commander, or as
     directed by AMC/A3V to meet ASEV evaluation requirements.
     5.2.1.6. (Added-302AW) Squadron Commanders, through SQ/DOV, can direct that a
     specific evaluation include certain areas or a certain profile. Prior to beginning the flight
     evaluation, it must be clear if these elements are required in order to complete the
     evaluation or if the flight examiner may declare the evaluation complete without them
     due to changes that occur after mission start. Examples include actual airdrops, NVGs,
     two routes (SKE and VIS), or certain patient load.
     5.2.1.7. (Added-302AW) All initial flight examiner upgrades in the 302 AW will
     receive a supervisory ride from a senior flight examiner following certification. The
     upgrading flight examiner will administer a flight evaluation while a senior flight
     examiner monitors the conduct of the evaluation during the ground and flight phase to
     ensure their objectivity, adherence to local procedures, and to provide any required
     advice.
  5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying
  resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
  designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8, e.g., QUAL/MSN or
  INSTM/QUAL/MSN. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM
  supplements.
  5.2.2. (AMC) Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. If in-flight evaluations (e.g.
  QUAL and MSN) cannot be completed within the same calendar month, use a separate AF
  FORM 8 with a separate expiration date or as specified in AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used,
  when applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.5:
     5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
     qualification in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a flight
     recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.9 for ground rechecks),
     or loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade.
         5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
         evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
         evaluation. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an
         RQ prefix. NOTE: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure
         to complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4), the
         flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period for an
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                    39


        in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2 for
        an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, and the OG/CC determines that
        qualification will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-
        accomplishment of the flight evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in
        paragraph 5.2.16, the AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will not be
        documented with an RQ prefix.
        5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
        will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those
        items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check
        description will be documented with RQ SPOT. See also AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
        Aircrew Training, for policy regarding loss of currency.
        5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the
        recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13. The AF Form
        8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT,
        as applicable.
        5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 7.4.8), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The AF
        Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ
        SPOT, as applicable.
        5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
        qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
        5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8/8a
        Mission/Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
     5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
     of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
     beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner
     and may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The intent is to preclude
     extraordinary preparation for the mission.
        5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
            5.2.3.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) N/N In-flight Evaluation Program. Each level of
            command (SQ/OG/AMC) will execute a N/N program. Develop the N/N program
            as an assessment tool for overall unit readiness and to provide indicators for
            appraisal and re-focusing unit training programs. OG and SQ levels will develop
            and publish a program to sample a combined minimum goal of 15% of available
            (qualified to perform aircrew duties) crewmembers (by crew position) annually. If
            a unit has less than five crewmembers in a given crew position, N/N goal is at the
            commander’s discretion.
            5.2.3.3.1.2. (Added-AMC) Crewmembers will not receive more than one N/N
            evaluation per calendar year except as directed by their commander. This
            restriction does not affect HQ AMC or AFRC/NAF evaluators conducting N/N
            evaluations in the mobility system or SPOT evaluations in conjunction with unit
40                              AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


        ASEV requirements. Evaluators in the mobility system may conduct only one
        N/N evaluation per crew-member (maximum) per mission.
        5.2.3.3.1.3. (Added-AMC) Avoid administering N/N evaluations within the
        eligibility period unless commander directed.
        5.2.3.3.1.4. (Added-AMC) For mobility aircrews, as a minimum, all N/N
        evaluations will include items designated under ―General‖ as defined in the
        appropriate aircrew member’s chapter of the AFI 11-2MDS-Spe-cific Volume 2.
        Evaluate other areas, as appropriate.
        5.2.3.3.1.5. (Added-AMC) Evaluators will use items from the special interest
        program to target and assess specific areas during all N/N evaluations. Areas
        designated "special interest" are normally identified by higher headquarters
        message. OG and squadron may also designate areas. Squadron and OG will
        provide feedback on special interest areas through the SEB. Squadron, OG, and
        HQ AMC will develop a process to inform evaluators on the requirements of the
        special interest program.
        5.2.3.3.1.6. (Added-AMC) Detail the unit's N/N program (including N/N rate
        goal) in the unit supplement.
     5.2.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a
     QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
     evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. If all
     requirements were not completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized
     to complete required events. If the examinee elects not to update a
     QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented
     as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.3.3.2. (AMC) Before the start of a N/N evaluation and with the concurrence of
     the evaluator, the examinee may request that items accomplished during the
     evaluation be credited toward a periodic evaluation. Do not add on missions (flights)
     to complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/ squadron
     commander concurs with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation
     expiration date and approves the additional flight time requirements.
     5.2.3.3.3. (Added-302AW) No-notice (N/N) in-flight evaluation program. SQ/DOV
     will monitor each crew position to ensure a minimum of 15% of available members
     receive a N/N evaluation each calendar year. The number of N/N evaluations
     required should be based on the squadron’s letter of X’s and include attached flyers
     regardless of mission ready status. The annual goal should be determined at the
     January SEB and can be adjusted at the July SEB based on manning changes.
        5.2.3.3.3.1. (Added-302AW) Any SQ or OG evaluator can conduct a N/N
        evaluation but must coordinate with stan/eval to ensure compliance with the AMC
        sup 1. Section supervisors, SQ/DO, or SQ/CC should be notified of the
        evaluation prior to the start of the mission.
        5.2.3.3.3.2. (Added-302AW) N/N evaluations should target Special Interest
        Items (SII), trends, off-station missions, or Joint Airborne/Air Transportability
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                       41


             Trainers (JA/ATT). Individuals can be selected by SQ/DOV or OG/OGV to
             receive a N/N evaluation based on recency of upgrade or recent history of
             negative performance.
             5.2.3.3.3.3. (Added-302AW) Once a N/N evaluation has begun it should be
             completed even if the flight does not occur due to weather or maintenance.
             Annotate the event as a N/N EPE in the Ground Phase of the Form 8. N/N
             evaluations that do not include a flight phase will not be counted towards the 15%
             squadron goal.
     5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
     in a simulator.
     5.2.3.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
     evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission Description
     in the Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraphs 7.3.7.3 and 7.4.7.3).
  5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew evaluations
  includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guidance on
  aircrew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination,
     Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
     5.2.4.1. (AMC) QUAL Evaluations. Publications Check. Each aircrew member, while
     performing aircrew duties, is responsible for assigned publications according to the
     appropriate AFI11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3. For aircrew members participating in the
     Electronic Publications program, the publications review conducted as part of an
     evaluation will include a check for currency. The evaluatee will demonstrate ability to
     navigate through and locate information in the electronic media. The evaluatee will
     demonstrate ability to locate information in paper publications required for in-flight use
     (i.e. checklists, publications kits, etc). If during the flight evaluation the publications are
     checked IAW AFI 11-215, this will suffice for the annual review. In this case the flight
     examiner will sign the AF IMT 1522.
     5.2.4.2. INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination.
     5.2.4.3. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
  performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
  appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and allow
  accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
  tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the
  unit mission.
  5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
     17th month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a
42                                 AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


     periodic evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 04 expires on 31
     Mar 06.).
     5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (six-month
     period prior to expiration date).
     5.2.6.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by-
     case basis according to the following criteria:
        5.2.6.3.1. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders
        may extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to three months for the
        reasons listed below.
            5.2.6.3.1.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
            5.2.6.3.1.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft
            type.
            5.2.6.3.1.3. Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
            5.2.6.3.1.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or
            retirement from the Service).
            5.2.6.3.1.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include
            operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
            flight evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case
            basis and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
            deployments.
        5.2.6.3.2. For squadron commanders and above, the approval authority is the next
        commander in the member’s flying chain of command, with the concurrence of the
        member’s immediate supervisor, IAW the guidance provided in paragraph 5.2.6.3.1.
        For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval authority.
        5.2.6.3.3. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize the
        extension of expiration dates of periodic aircrew qualification evaluations.
        5.2.6.3.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a memorandum for record
        (MFR) placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new
        expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension.
            5.2.6.3.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
            affected periodic evaluation.
            5.2.6.3.4.2. File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8/8a in Section II of the
            FEF.
            5.2.6.3.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
            completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
            5.2.6.3.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
            AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments,
            when action is complete and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record
            become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed
            by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Example: If an
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                    43


             evaluation was extended based on an HHQ waiver, an MFR will remain in the
             FEF until such time as the next evaluation is completed. That waiver reference is
             commented on in para D of the Form 8/8a.
     5.2.6.4. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
     periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
     Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to a flying assignment in the same aircraft MDS, or
     during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY) (flying or non-flying), complete the
     required evaluation(s) before departing for either the PCS flying assignment or the TDY.
     Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval waiver for unusual situations.
  5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2. Requisites from a
  completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided they cover all
  required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. See also paragraph 5.3.1.
  For aircrew possessing multiple instrument qualifications, the instrument exam may count for
  separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs for each evaluation IAW the
  provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1 and 5.2.7.2. For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as
  follows:
     5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility
     period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that
     expiration date.
     5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
     period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
     month in which the flight evaluation was administered. EXCEPTION: For extended
     evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
     eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
     5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
         5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1 or
         5.2.7.2 remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.13.1.
         5.2.7.3.2. Valid requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
         annotated on the recheck AF Form 8/8a. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include
         documentation of the flight phase evaluation, unless requisites were not completed or
         are required to complete the recheck. If the flight recheck is completed prior to
         completion of required requisites, delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until
         requisites are complete and enter the requisites on the recheck AF Form 8/8a.
         5.2.7.3.2. (AMC) In the event a recheck for a flight evaluation is completed prior to
         completion of all ground requisites, the individual must complete the requisites for
         the initial evaluation before the Re-Qual is administered.
  5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not
  possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight
  examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to
44                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


  this option. See the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, for areas prohibited from
  verbal/ATD evaluation.
  5.2.8. (AMC) Alternate Means of Evaluation. Do not verbally evaluate takeoffs,
  instrument approaches, landings, aerial refueling contacts, cargo loads or nursing care
  standards unless specified in the AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD
  10-9, in coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized
  INSTM, INSTR, MSN and QUAL evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
  Specific Volume 2. The lead command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
     5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those
     required and critical for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged
     into general and specific evaluation areas. Where required, mission areas/subareas will be
     further subdivided into general and specific mission areas.
     5.2.9.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Check. This is required for QUAL
     evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
         5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as
         outlined in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific series publications.
         5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current
         and properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
         members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
         required for the mission.
     5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the
     appropriate areas/subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
     Training Program, and MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
     5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
     and procedures. Must specifically ensure compliance with minimum safe maneuvering
     speeds below 10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission planning and
     flight operations.
  5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
  aircrew performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
  areas/subareas of aircrew performance are individually graded against established evaluation
  criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall
  qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
     5.2.10.1. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will establish
     areas and subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations - to
     include the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have
     a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be
     documented against the listed subareas.
         5.2.10.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
         satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within
         the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                    45


        5.2.10.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
        area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
        flight examiner. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
        prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
        5.2.10.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
        parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
        affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
        receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in
        the judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively
        improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner
        must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.2.10.2. Critical Area. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for the establishment of
     evaluation areas that, upon failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of an
     aircrew member. Critical areas include, but are not limited to, Airmanship, Flight
     Discipline and Safety. Grade all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Qualification Levels. EPEs and overall evaluation performance are graded by
     qualification levels as follows:
        5.2.10.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
        performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
        tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
        discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
            5.2.10.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
            area(s)/subarea(s).
            5.2.10.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies
            preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
            5.2.10.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during
            the debrief of that evaluation.
        5.2.10.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the
        ability to perform duties safely, but:
            5.2.10.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
            was assigned.
            5.2.10.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
            5.2.10.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
            performance in one or several areas/subareas.
        5.2.10.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
        unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
        5.2.10.3.3. (AMC) Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). Any requisite examination
        resulting in a failure to meet the minimum passing grade IAW para. 6.4.3.1 will
        result in an overall Q-3. After successful re-examination IAW para. 6.4.6, the overall
        qualification level will be annotated as ―3/1‖ in the qualified block on the AF FORM
        8 (and AF IMT 942, Record of Evaluation).
46                                 AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


            5.2.10.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
            for the evaluation.
            5.2.10.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
            examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several
            areas/subareas.
     5.2.10.4. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q)
     or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.5. Written, Computer Based, or Electronic Examinations. Grade written,
     computer based, or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See
     paragraph 6.4.4.1 for minimum passing grade criteria.
  5.2.11. Grading Policies.
     5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on
     requisite examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-
     /U) grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the
     applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas.
         5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in
         the general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
         Volume 2.
         5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner will grade any area/subarea observed during an
         evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
         accomplished or flight safety.
         5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft
         conditions.
         5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
         acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
         deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
         determining the overall area/subarea grade.
         5.2.11.2.5. The flight examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as
         ―Commendable‖ if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has
         demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area.
         Document commendable areas in the examiner’s remarks section of the AF Form
         8/8a.
     5.2.11.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
         5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
         performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-
         2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and
         given due consideration. An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.
         5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must
         satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                 47


         demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively
         during all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-2
         MDS Specific Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE
         based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the
         determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
     5.2.11.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation
     may be awarded by the flight examiner. The designation can only be applied to the total
     evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
         5.2.11.4.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
         all phases of the evaluation;
         5.2.11.4.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
         5.2.11.4.3. The aircrew member received a qualified grade with no remedial action
         on all areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.13 when discrepancies result in failure
  to pass a flight evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the
     discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
     proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is
     annotated with ―Debriefed‖ in paragraph B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF
     Form 8/8a Comments.
     5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to
     remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
         5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a
         simulator or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.12.2.1. (AMC) Initial qualification examinees will not fly as a qualified
         crewmember until additional training is complete.
         5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks in the AF Form 8/8a Comments
         section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
         knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or instructor.
         5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8/8a (see paragraphs 7.3.5.5 and
         7.4.5.5).
         5.2.12.2.4. The flight examiner or instructor who completed the additional training
         will sign as the Certifying Official under Additional Training, Section II, verifying
48                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


         completion of all assigned training as documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examiner’s Remarks.
         5.2.12.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
         Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date
         of the discrepancy, e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 06, additional training must be
         accomplished by 30 Apr 06. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for
         completion of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation
         and direct appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in
         Section II of the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained
         in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D,
         Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFRs from the FEF.
         Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major
         discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
            5.2.12.2.5.1. (Added-AMC) Instructors, flight examiners, or authorized Aircrew
            Training System (ATS) contractor instructor personnel administer additional
            training.
            5.2.12.2.5.2. (Added-AMC) If additional training is not completed by due date,
            the aircrew member will fly in supervised status.
            5.2.12.2.5.3. (Added-AMC) An instructor or flight examiner graded Q-2 on any
            evaluation will not perform instructor or examiner duties until the Q-2 is cleared.
            Flight examiners will clear instructor Q-2s. Flight examiner Q-2s should be
            cleared according to the pyramid evaluation system.
  5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
     5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or
     ground recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first
     failure, e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 07, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 07. A
     recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or
     Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in
     this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in
     Section II of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
     action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
     permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
     addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Every reasonable effort must be made to
     requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed
     during this period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and
     hours of training required. The flight examiner that administered the original check will
     not normally administer the recheck.
     5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM,
     QUAL or MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-
     CMR), non-basic mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ)
     status, as applicable. For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC)
     need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                    49


     5.2.13.2. (AMC) Status Downgrade. Mission evaluations graded overall Q-3 will
     result in non-mission ready status in that mission only.
         5.2.13.2.1. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Downgrade to lower crew duty position. In
         those cases where failure of a flight evaluation results in downgrading to a lower crew
         duty qualification (that is, instructor pilot to aircraft commander, aircraft commander
         to first pilot, etc.), these individuals may perform duty in the lower position without
         supervision provided that this action was recommended by the flight evaluator and
         properly annotated on the AF FORM 8.
  5.2.14. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.2.14.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.2.14.1.1. Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require restrictions to
         ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
         5.2.14.1.2. If defined in the MDS specific Volume 1 and/or Volume 2, formal
         schoolhouses will include restrictions on the AF Forms 8 for any core item not
         accomplished due to training limimitations, regardless if the method of qualification
         is by evaluation or instructor certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew
         perform core items in which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision
         of an instructor. In this case, MDS specific guidance will set the time requirement for
         completion of additional training.
     5.2.14.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item of the AF Form 8/8a Comments. Restrictions associated
     with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8/8a.
     5.2.14.3. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation until a successful evaluation
     is completed:
         5.2.14.3.1. For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in the
         aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
         evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For specialized
         qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining
         qualification for similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
         may direct supervised status in all aircraft in which the individual maintains
         qualification.
         5.2.14.3.1. (AMC) Qualification Evaluation. AECMs who Q-3 in one qualification
         aircraft will fly in supervised status in all aircraft until recheck in that aircraft is
         complete.
         5.2.14.3.2. For INSTM evaluations, restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.2.14.3.3. MSN       Evaluation.    The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
50                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


         5.2.14.3.3. (AMC) Only applies to the specific Q-3 mission.
         5.2.14.3.4. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any
         instructor area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is
         completed.
         5.2.14.3.4. (AMC) Re-evaluation may be administered in the aircraft, verbally, or in
         an Aircrew Training Device (ATD) at the examiner's discretion.
         5.2.14.3.5. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Squadron commanders review the records
         of aircrew members who fail a flight evaluation. Document the commander’s review
         in the individual’s FEF. Squadron commander’s signature in Section III of the AF
         FORM 8 satisfies this requirement.
             5.2.14.3.5.1. (Added-AMC) AGR, ART, and Traditional Reservist (TR) aircrew
             members are disqualified or removed from aviation service when they indicate a
             repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance according to AFI 11-
             402, as supplemented, and reassigned to a non-flying position or removed under
             the provisions of AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.
             5.2.14.3.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian aircrew members are notified according to
             AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program, when they fail to pass
             a qualification examination or flight evaluation. They may be removed from
             aviation service and reassigned to a non-flying position, or removed under the
             provisions of AFI 36-704 when they indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or
             marginal performance.
  5.2.15. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the aircrew
  member be placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated
  supervisor) will be determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified
  in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or
  designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1) qualified in the
  specific aircrew position.
  5.2.15. (302AW) A stan/eval notification Checklist will be filled out by flight examiners
  when a crewmember must be placed on supervised status, grounded for a boldface failure, or
  when less than Q-1 performance is observed. The flight examiner initiating the checklist will
  immediately notify SQ/DOV, OG/OGV, SQ/DO, or AE scheduler in person or via telephone.
  The checklist can be filled out manually or electronically. Secondary notifications can be
  accomplished via e-mail regardless of how the checklist is completed. Secondary
  notification should be accomplished immediately following the debrief and must include the
  following individuals: SQ/CC, SQ/DO, FLT/CC or supervisor, SQ/DOV or OG/OGV,
  SARM, and SQ/DOT. A copy of the checklist will be included in any required training
  folder and the original will be returned to SQ/DOV when complete.
  5.2.16. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in
  paragraph 5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses
  the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.14.3 apply.
  Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                    51


  paragraph 5.2.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs may approve
  waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
  evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II
  of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form
  8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete,
  and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF
  only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a
  later Form 8/8a.
  5.2.17. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members
  who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft. When differences
  between series aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead MAJCOM, in
  coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate qualification
  requirements. When separate qualification is not required, document certification in different
  MDS series using AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form
  4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification
  document signed by an authorized official (such as a Letter of X’s).
     5.2.17.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
     including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in an MFR placed in
     Section II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority
     may be delegated, but not lower than wing commander.) See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for
     additional guidance.
     5.2.17.1. (AMC) For O-6 and below, HQ AMC/A3 is approval authority according to
     AFI 11-202 Volume 1. Forward request through channels (Sq/CC, OG/CC, AMC/A3V,
     etc.). For AFRC, HQ AFRC/DO is approval authority. Refer to AFI 11-202 Vol 1, AFRC
     Sup 1 for procedures to request multiple qualifications. For ANG, approval authority is
     NGB/A3O. Multiple qualifications of General Officers is IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
     AMC/A3V AF Flight Nurse (FN) and Aeromedical Evacuation Technician (AET)
     examiners may maintain multiple qualifications in the C-17, C-130, KC-135 and C-21
     when applicable.
         5.2.17.1.1. (Added-AMC) Approved          crewmembers       completing     multiple
         qualifications see the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 1 for training
         requirements. Complete certification or evaluation according to the appropriate AFI
         11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     5.2.17.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
     include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified
     by the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are
     directed by the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
     5.2.17.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL
     evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission
     design series aircraft according to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. When
     specified IAW paragraph 5.2.17, QUAL and MSN evaluations are required for different
     series aircraft in the same MDS.
52                                   AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


     5.2.17.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results
     in a downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A
     downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft
     for which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the
     discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft.
  5.2.18. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized
  aircrew who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft where
  qualification is attained/maintained via a minimum of a ground phase examination.
  MAJCOMs may require a flight phase evaluation. AE crewmembers require a ground and
  flight phase evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2AE, Volume 2. The flight phase evaluation, when
  required, may be accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either
  gaining or maintaining qualification, and will update qualification on all aircraft listed on the
  specialized aircrew member’s Aeronautical Order (AO). MAJCOMs may specify additional
  ground phase requisites.
     5.2.18.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications
     IAW Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified
     crewmember eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
     5.2.18.2. Documentation. Specialized aircrew qualifications maintained under
     Universal qualification guidance will be documented on an AF Form 8a, IAW paragraph
     7.4 AECM qualification will be documented using AF Form 8, IAW paragraph 7.3.
     Flight surgeon qualification may be documented using either AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a,
     IAW paragraph 8.2.8 or paragraph 8.2.9.
     5.2.18.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications
     maintained under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A
     MSN evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
     and/or MAJCOM supplement to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will
     include a flight phase evaluation in one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member
     maintains qualification.
     5.2.18.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally
     qualified aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in
     loss of applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI 11-2 MDS-
     Specific Volumes 2.
  5.2.19. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
  Units. Aircrew members authorized to perform duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
  AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host
  service or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a current physical
  and review their flight records according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily
  abide by USAF guidance, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
  Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must complete applicable
  requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during their tour.
  The restrictions in paragraph 5.2.14 of this instruction apply to such individuals until
  successful evaluations are completed.
NOTE:
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                         53


   1. MAJCOMs may approve exceptions to requirements for returning aircrew members to
   complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case review,
   they determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
   Volume 2 evaluations. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF
   on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8 equivalent.
   2. Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying program
   will comply with current Air Force guidance, unless excepted by proper authority. See AFI
   11-401 for definitions of Air Force and US Government aircraft.
   5.2.20. (Added-302AW) SQ/DOV will maintain the letter of Xs using PEX certifications or
   suitable alternate. SQ/DOT will process AF Forms 4324 and 1522 to maintain AFI 11-2C-
   130V1 required Q Codes in the ARMS database. AF Forms 4324 should be initiated by
   SQ/DOT, routed through SQ/DOV or OG/OGV, signed by the SQ/CC, and returned to
   SQ/DOT prior to SARM processing. The original letter of Xs will be maintained by
   SQ/DOV. Copies will be distributed to OG/OGV and the section schedulers as a minimum.
   731 AS/DOV and 52 AS/DOV will post a current copy at the sign in desk for the Go-No Go
   process. Maintain certifications in accordance with Figure 5.1.

5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations.
   5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs and systems
   knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and
   systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for
   each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN
   evaluation). A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
   INSTM/QUAL eval). The combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required
   areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
   5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the
   proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is
   responsible for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
   5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will specify
   contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading criteria and whether EPEs may be
   done inflight, in an ATD, or verbally.
   5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade 1, 2, or 3 (Qualification
   Level 1, 2, or 3) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8a, regardless of
   whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed inflight.
   5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner
   will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before next flight under
   restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 8/8a.
   5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
   an EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a 3 grade as
   a result of Boldface/CAPs error will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
   accomplished.
   5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (3) will be
   placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
   5.3.8. (Added-302AW) SQ/DOV may require EPEs to be accomplished prior to
   scheduling/accomplishing the flight evaluation or prior to entering the last month of
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                  55


   eligibility. EPEs will be documented on EPE Worksheets or AF Forms 3862 and submitted
   to SQ/DOV upon completion. When an EPE is completed the overall grade will be recorded
   in PEX by SQ/DOV. Completed EPE worksheets will be retained by SQ/DOV until the data
   is incorporated into the trends program.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These
evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists)
where results are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander.
   5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
   5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the
   method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection, and
   will report results as directed by the commander.
   5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct
   supplementary evaluations.
   5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all-
   encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific aircrew
   member, nor be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
   5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.
   5.4.6. (Added-302AW) Supplementary evaluations can be initiated by OG/OGV on behalf
   of the WG/CC, OG/CC, or SQ/CCs. SQ/DOV can initiate a supplementary evaluation on
   behalf of the SQ/CC or SQ/DO. Instructors, joint airdrop inspectors (JAI), or supervisors
   may be used to conduct supplementary evaluations under the guidance and direction of
   OG/OGV or SQ/DOV.
 56                                   AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


                                           Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer-based
or electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, navigators, and air battle managers), career
enlisted aviator (CEA), and non-rated X-prefix AE aircrew. For Flight Surgeons (rated) and non-
rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code), see Chapter 8. The
examination program in this chapter includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and
unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open book and closed
book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in
paragraph 5.2.4. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination program
   in the unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.1. (302AW) Aircrew examinations will be computer generated using a random question
   generator to the maximum extent possible. When PEX is used to generate a unique test for
   each aircrew member, two backup tests will be generated and printed for use when PEX is
   not available for an extended period of time. If used, a paper test will be retained in the
   member’s FEF until the Form 8 is complete. Testing should be accomplished in the
   OG/OGV testing room to the maximum extent possible. Examinees will bring issued
   publications and flight manuals to test with. Any certified flight examiner can proctor a test.
   Tests will be graded immediately upon completion.
   6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
   information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
   this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam
   answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs, secure
   question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
   documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may
   be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing and
   updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.4. (302AW) OG/OGV will review Master Question Files (MQF) upon issue from AMC
   prior to issue or testing. Questions that are inappropriate due to unique unit requirements or
   aircraft configuration should be omitted from the issued MQF and from the testing secure
   question bank. Each crew position may add up to 25 locally generated questions as a
   supplement to the MQF and for use in closed book testing.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                   57


   6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses
   listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
   (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the
   requirements of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite
   examinations.
      6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate
      with the MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of
      this instruction and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 before awarding credit for
      requisite completion.
      6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs.
      All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures
      and not conflict with any MQFs.
      6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will
      be graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1 and entered on the AF Form 8 according to
      paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and
Boldface/CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.1), instrument examination as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.2), and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
Specific Volume 2 (see paragraph 5.2.4.3).
6.4. (AMC) Unless otherwise specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 2,
individuals qualified as crewmembers in more than one MDS aircraft must complete open and
closed book exam for each aircraft.
   6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs
   examinations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position or generate a
   unique test for each aircrew member requiring an exam.
      6.4.1.1. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position:
          6.4.1.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two requisite
          examinations for each crew position.
          6.4.1.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one
          examination.
          6.4.1.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information,
          units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
          6.4.1.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on requisite
          examinations each calendar year.
      6.4.1.2. If a unique test is generated for each aircrew member requiring an exam:
          6.4.1.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation.
          6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
          ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
          generated.
58                                 AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


  6.4.2. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
  requisite exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
  EXCEPTION: Requisite Open-book Flight Surgeon examination will be maintained by
  AFMOA/SG3P.
  6.4.3. Grading Policy For Examinations.
     6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs
     exams is 100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite
     examinations is 85 percent - corrected to 100 percent.
     6.4.3.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will
     grade all completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew member’s
     next flight. In the unit supplement to this instruction describe how this restriction is
     enforced.
  6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
     6.4.4.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from
     publications containing information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and
     performance of the assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications
     used to generate the exam will be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an
     open book secure question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the
     open book examination questions. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
     safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval examination. Electronic
     publications may be used for open book examinations.
         6.4.4.1.1. (Added-AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific
         Volume 2, Open book exam will be derived from the Secure Question Bank (SQB)
         for each crew position of each MDS. The OG/OGV will create and manage the Open
         book examination process. Open book questions will be drawn from appropriate
         information contained in FCIF Volumes I, II, III, and IV.
            6.4.4.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Crewmembers qualified to conduct ground taxi
            operations will be tested on their knowledge of marshaling signals IAW AFI 11-
            218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. Units may administer a
            ground marshaling examination as part of the open book examination.
         6.4.4.1.2. (Added-AMC) A portion of each open book exam will include questions
         pertaining to each mission qualification of the individual being tested. Include
         airdrop, AR, SOLL II, PNAF, cargo, instructor (scenario type), etc., as required.
     6.4.4.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs.
     These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe
     flight and mission accomplishment.
         6.4.4.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-
         Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are available
         for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable aircrew.
         6.4.4.2.1. (AMC) If not specified in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume
         2, mobility forces complete their closed book examination using a minimum of 20
         questions from the MQF. When developing a closed book examination from the
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                 59


        MQF, the unit should select questions to sample aircrew knowledge areas or correct
        potential trends.
            6.4.4.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may
            develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without MAJCOM
            expertise. That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM for
            approval prior to their publication.
            6.4.4.2.1.1. (AMC) HQ AMC/A3V will coordinate, build, maintain and
            distribute one common MQF for each crew position of each MDS. The MQF will
            contain at least 100 questions with periodic updates, as necessary. A
            comprehensive MQF is encouraged. MQF questions will be derived from the
            basic aircraft flight manual, performance manual, other applicable technical
            orders, AFI 11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3, AFTTP 3-1.1, AFTTP 3-1.2 and
            AFTTP 3-1/3 MDS Specific. AMC/A3V may delegate a portion or all of MQF
            development and maintenance requirements to specific active duty, ANG, or
            AFRC units; or a designated civilian contractor providing this service, but will
            maintain active supervision of MQF contents.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes
            to MQFs as necessary.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. (AMC) MQFs are available for download on the AMC/A3V
            website. The OG will distribute the MQF to all unit aircrew members.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
                administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
                procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.1. (AMC) OGV will forward corrections to AMC/A3V.
                6.4.4.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate
                MAJCOM.
        6.4.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local
        procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs.
        6.4.4.2.2. (AMC) May be included in the SQB.
     6.4.4.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the
     Instrument MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The
     selection and content of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
     6.4.4.3. (AMC) Instrument Requisite Exams. Exam requirements follow open book
     format and the exam is normally generated at the unit level. IRC program and Instrument
     Examination questions are available on Air Force Flight Standardization Agency
     (AFFSA)                     website,                       IRC                     Page:
     https://wwwmil.andrews.af.mil/pages/AFFSA/xo/xof/xof_dir.htm.
        6.4.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) instrument
        examinations remain valid concurrent with the individual's initial qualification
        instrument evaluation. IRC or equivalent courseware may satisfy this requirement.
        Units will determine an internal process for managing ENJJPT instrument
60                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


        examination dates and scores. Incorporate the scores on the individual’s first initial
        qualification AF Form 8.
     6.4.4.4. (Added-AMC) Tactics Requisite Exams. All pilots, navigators, flight engineers
     and loadmasters will accomplish a Tactics Examination as a requisite to their recurring
     mission evaluation. Boom operators will accomplish the tactics exam as a requisite to
     their air refueling qual (KC-10) and qual/msn (KC-135) flight evaluation, and not in
     association with their qual/msn (KC-10) and msn (KC-135) cargo evaluation.
     Communications System Operators (CSO) Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
     (AECM) and Flight Attendants (FA) are not required to take the Tactics exam.
      The tactics exam will consist of a minimum of 25 questions from the Secure
      Question Bank (SQB). Tactics exams are not crewmember specific. Only two test
      versions are required IAW para 6.4.1.1.1. Include tactics exam scores on the AF
      FORM 8 .
     6.4.4.4. (302AW) The tactics test will be administered in the tactics vault. Two
     versions of this test will be available at all times. Tactics personnel will retain testing
     sheets for a minimum of 6 months.
        6.4.4.4.1. (Added-AMC) AMC Tactics has created a classified secure question bank
        (SQB) for each MDS which may be obtained by contacting AMC/A3D at DSN: 779-
        1765. AMC/ A3D will continue to maintain the AMC tactics SQB. Instructions for
        obtaining        the      SQB          are       on         SIPRNET           at:
        http://www.amc.scott.af.smil.mil/hosted_orgs/dok/A39T/G060/G060.htm.
        6.4.4.4.2. (Added-AMC) OG/CCs will determine the best way to facilitate the
        Tactics exam based on group manning and logistics/secure areas. OG/CCs are
        encouraged to use the resources at their disposal to provide suitable classified testing
        and study areas. The long term goal is for units to acquire appropriate AMCI11-207
        compliant facilities and for Stan/Eval to begin producing and administering the tactics
        exam. Access to electronic publications is preferred where practical.
  6.4.5. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.5.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated
     through a written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
     6.4.5.1. (AMC) Examinations will consist of one question concerning each Bold
     Face/Critical Action Emergency Procedure applicable to an individual's specialty.
     Individuals qualified as crew members in more than one MDS aircraft must complete a
     Bold Face exam for each aircraft.
     6.4.5.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing
     the proper actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight
     examiner will assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase
     block of the AF Form 8/8a.
     6.4.5.2. (AMC) AMC policy is that Bold Face will be written as depicted in the flight
     manual (dash 1 or Vol 3 for AECM) aircrew checklists, to include the correct crew
     positions for the prescribed action. Unit commanders will ensure that crews are trained to
     this standard; however, HQ AMC does not intend for examiners to quibble over
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                  61


     punctuation or minor misspellings. AFRC units will accomplish a Boldface Exam prior to
     the first flight of each month.
  6.4.6. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all
  failed items have been successfully re-accomplished.
  6.4.6. (302AW) Exam failures should be thoroughly debriefed by the flight examiner
  proctoring the exam. A stan/eval notification checklist will be completed and the individual
  should be given adequate study time before retesting. Boldface failures should be remedied
  the same day.
     6.4.6.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination at
     any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other
     than Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
     6.4.6.1. (AMC) Reexamination Policy. An initial qualification or requalification
     student who fails an Aircrew Training System (ATS) examination while attending
     FTU/CCTS training will retake the ATS exam and complete the appropriate open and
     closed book examinations before flight evaluations.
     6.4.6.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination
     must complete a successful reexamination by the end of the third month following the
     date of the first failure, or the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first.
     Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is
     the OG/CC. Document such waivers with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF of the
     affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
     action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
     permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
     addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
     6.4.6.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
     Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is
     accomplished.
     6.4.6.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite
     open book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful
     retesting is completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications,
     supervised status resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination
     applies only to the aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of a
     requisite instrument exam results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all
     aircraft in which instrument qualification is required.
     6.4.6.5. (Added-AMC) AFRC only. Squadron commanders review flying records of
     aircrew members who fail to take or pass a written standardization examination.
     Document this review describing the circumstances/ actions to be taken and keep on file
     in the unit standardization/training section until corrective action is completed. R&C
     Board action will fulfill this requirement.
         6.4.6.5.1. (Added-AMC) AGR, ART, and Traditional Reservist aircrew members
         are:
 62                                   AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


               6.4.6.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Notified in writing of unsatisfactory performance
               when they fail to pass a written examination. Notification includes the training
               program to be pursued to restore the individual’s qualification.
               6.4.6.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Disqualified or removed from aviation service when
               they indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance according
               to AFI 11-402, as supplemented, and reassigned to a non-flying position or
               removed under the provisions of AFI 36-704.
           6.4.6.5.2. (Added-AMC) Civilian aircrew members are:
               6.4.6.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Notified according to AFI 36-1001 when they fail to
               pass a qualification examination or flight evaluation.
               6.4.6.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) Removed from aviation service and reassigned to a
               non-flying position, or removed under the provisions of AFI 36-704 when they
               indicate a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance.
6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a
requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. Units will
describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed
exams.
6.5. (302AW) Unit periodic examinations may be used as a tool for correcting weak areas,
training in new equipment or procedures, or at the commanders’ discretion. Passing grade will
be 85% unless otherwise published. Exam length, open or closed book status, and due date will
be designated for each test.
   6.5.1. (Added-AMC) An AF Form 8 will not be generated simply for a failed periodic
   examination.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which an aircrew member is to be
evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of aircrew evaluations
are recorded on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a, which certifies the qualification of the aircrew
member. The chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF
Form 942, Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the aircrew
member. EXCEPTION: Not required for cadets participating in USAFA airmanship programs.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Aircrew qualifications are attained through evaluations
and documented on the AF Form 8 or the AF Form 8a, as applicable. Aircrew certifications
attained through methods other than evaluation (instructor-certified events and commander
certifications for example) may be documented on an AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air
Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. As an alternative to use of AF
Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document
signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification. Certification of an AF
   Form 8 is accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who
   completes the evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final
   Approving Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all
   required additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete,
   and sign the AF Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8. EXCEPTION: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8,
   only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.4.8.
       7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see
       paragraph 7.3.9).
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8.
   See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.
       7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-
       digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.
       7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter
       month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by
       the form.
       7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph 7.3.7
       , sample AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the data
       presented (see Attachment 3).
       7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
       otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.

     7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
     (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
     specific format standards for such data entry.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date (ground or flight phase) of the evaluation
     requisites or the additional training.
     7.3.3.2. Use this date on the AF Form 942.
  7.3.4. Section I - Examinee Identification.

     7.3.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the aircraft MDS in which the evaluation was given.
         7.3.4.3.2. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation (e.g., IP, MP, MN, MF, MAWO, ISD, IAM, etc.) in that particular aircraft
         MDS. NOTE: Examiner is not a qualification, it is a certification, and should only be
         entered when demonstrated during the evaluation, i.e., a SPOT evaluation in which
         the examinee receives an evaluation while administering an evaluation.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation
         expires Sep 05, enter Apr-Sep 05).
         7.3.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for initial periodic aircrew qualification
         evaluations, SPOT evaluations, and requalification (RQ) evaluations.
         7.3.4.4.3. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 06 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 07, enter
         ―INSTM: Jun-Nov 06/QUAL: Aug 06-Jan 07‖ for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
         7.3.4.4.4. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.2.6.3.1, enter the
         6-month period preceding the original expiration date. NOTE:                Squadron
         commanders extend only the expiration date, not the eligibility period.
  7.3.5. Section II - Qualification.
     7.3.5.1. Ground Phase.
         7.3.5.1.1. Examination/Check.

            evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR and SPOT.
            7.3.5.2.1.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.3.5.
            7.3.5.2.1.3. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
            INSTR as described in paragraphs 5.2.1.4.1 and 5.2.3.2.6.
            7.3.5.2.1.4. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.1.5. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and they are administered by either different flight
            examiners or on separate days. EXCEPTION: Where a single mission (such as

        for the aircrew member’s overall qualification level.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (i.e., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN) require
        only one qualification level number if all parts of the evaluation were awarded the
        same qualification level grade.
        7.3.5.3.3. If the qualification levels assigned parts of a combined evaluation vary,
        indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., ―INSTM: 1‖ and
        ―QUAL: 2‖ in the qualified block or ―INSTM/MSN: 1‖ in the qualified block and

        7.3.8.1. File a temporary evaluation certificate or a draft AF Form 8 in the aircrew
        member’s FEF after all evaluation requirements are complete (i.e., all ground and flight
        requisites) as a temporary record of the flight evaluation results.
        7.3.8.2. The temporary evaluation certificate or draft Form 8 will include examinee,
        examiner, type evaluation, qualification level, and date completed. List any discrepancies
        by area/subarea, any restrictions, any additional training and any additional training due
        dates. The examiner completing the evaluation will sign and date the certificate.
        Procedures concerning the temporary evaluation certificate will be outlined in the unit
        supplement.
        7.3.8.2. (302AW) AF Forms 3862 (temporary Forms 8) are made available to flight
        examiners prior to conducting the flight phase of an evaluation. They should contain
        enough information for the flight examiner to ensure all requirements that must be met to
        complete the evaluation. Upon completion, the flight examiner will sign the form and
        submit it to SQ/DOV or OG/OGV. Less than Q-1 performance requires a stan/eval
        notification checklist be initiated and the supervisor or stan/eval be personally notified.
        Incomplete flight evaluations should be signed in the remarks section and will identify
        areas still required to complete the evaluation. The AF Form 3862 will serve as a
        temporary evaluation certificate and will be placed in the individuals FEF.
        7.3.8.3. Remove the temporary evaluation certificate when the permanent AF Form 8 is
        filed in the FEF.
        7.3.8.4. File the completed AF Form 8 (all reviews/approvals accomplished) in the FEF
        not later than the end of the third month following the date completed on the AF Form 8.

   7.3.9. Ground Rechecks.
       7.3.9.1. Ground rechecks are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of an
       unqualified evaluation when the flight examiner deems a flight recheck unnecessary.
       7.3.9.2. The ground recheck will be documented on the original AF Form 8 generated to
       document the Q-3 flight evaluation.
       7.3.9.3. To document the ground recheck, follow instructions in paragraphs 7.3.3
       through 7.3.6, except as noted below:
           7.3.9.3.1. Date Completed. Use the latest completion date (ground phase or
           successful ground recheck) of the evaluation.
           7.3.9.3.2. Flight Phase. Document the date of the ground recheck on a separate line
           as ―GROUND RECHECK‖ below the flight evaluation entry under Flight Phase.

           recommended additional training associated with grading areas where deficiencies
           will be remedied by a ground recheck under subparagraph labeled Ground.
           7.3.9.3.6. The flight examiner that completed the flight evaluation will sign the front
           of the AF Form 8. If the recheck examiner is different than the initial flight examiner,
           the recheck examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement in the
           Comments/Examiner’s Remarks.
7.4. AF Form 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft). Use of AF Form
8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in multiple aircraft and/or multiple series
qualification in the same MDS. See Attachment 4 for sample AF Forms 8a.
   7.4.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8a to record aircrew qualification in multiple aircraft as
   demonstrated in required ground and flight evaluations. Certification of an AF Form 8a is
   accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who completes the
   evaluation by signing the AF Form 8a. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final Approving
   Officer review the contents, the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required
   additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and sign
   the AF Form 8a. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8a. Certification will not occur until all requisites of all aircraft for
   which the aircrew member possesses an aircraft AO are complete. EXCEPTIONS: Flight
   Surgeons and non-rated aircrew with only a ground phase examination do not require a
   Reviewing Officer’s signature, IAW paragraph 7.4.6.2. For a Commander-Directed
   Downgrade AF Form 8a, only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See
   paragraph 7.5.2.4.3.
       7.4.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8a for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.4.1.2. Failed ground phase requisites will be completed on the original AF Form 8a.

7.5. Commander-Directed Downgrade.
   7.5.1. Purpose. Any commander (squadron/detachment or above) in the aircrew member’s
   chain of command may direct a downgrade to an intermediate level of
   qualification/certification or unqualified/decertified status without administering an
   evaluation under the following guidance:
      7.5.1.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only, e.g., breach of flying discipline or
      flight safety - including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed, but by an
      examiner of another aircrew specialty.
      7.5.1.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
      administrative or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the
      commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s flying or performance ability to safely
      operate the aircraft and/or equipment.
   7.5.2. Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8/8a. Commanders will direct local
   stan/eval function to prepare an AF Form 8/8a as follows:
      7.5.2.1. Date Completed. The effective date of the downgrade. The crewmember will
      cease acting in the qualification(s) in which they have been downgraded. The date does
      not have to match the final approval officer signature date. It may be prior to or the same
      as the date of the final approval officer signature date, but will not be after the
      commander’s signature date.

7.6. AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training. Optional. If used, comply
with the following guidance when completing an AF Form 1381. MAJCOMs may prescribe use
of AF Form 1381 or AF Form 4348 (see paragraph 7.7). If prescribed, use either form. See
Attachment 6 for sample AF Form 1381.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 1381 provides a permanent record/certification source for
   aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification. (MAJCOMs may
   approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized official. An authorized
   official for a unit certification document will be an official authorized to approve an AF
   Form 8 or 8a, or another appropriate authority designated in writing by this official.)
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 1381 in the FEF, Section I, documenting
      certifications by individual assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew members
      with multiple aircraft certifications attained through difference training, only one AF
      Form 1381 is required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms
      1381 in chronological order with the most recent on top. NOTE: May also be filed in an
      aircrew member’s permanent training folder, as a training completion document. When

     AF Form 1381 is used as a training completion document, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume
     1, for guidance.
     7.6.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
     aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
     certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
         7.6.1.2.1. The AF Form 1381 will document all certifications attained in previous
         and current MDS(s). Retain as a historical source document. File AF Forms 1381 in
         chronological order with the most recent on top.
         7.6.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review AF Form 1381
         entries in the aircrew member’s training folder to determine applicable certifications
         of new assigned/attached aircrew members. Document aircrew certifications as
         specified by the assigned/attached flying unit commander on a new AF Form 1381.
             7.6.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the squadron
             commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries signifying acceptance
             of those events listed above (see paragraph 7.6.7              for documentation
             requirements).
         7.6.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form 1381
         certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.6.3.4.
     7.6.1.3. Do not use AF Form 1381 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
     directed by HHQ.
     7.6.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 1381
     entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
     Volume 1; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 3, MDS XX - Operations Procedures;
     CONOPS; HHQ messages; and local unit guidance.
     7.6.1.5. MAJCOMs supplements may specify procedures or sources for preparing AF
     Forms 1381.
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II) and last four of SSAN.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification or decertification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification or decertification in chronological order base on the date

  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also apples to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, line out the event, date and
         certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Decertification for Cause‖ under
         Training Requirement/Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
         Completed; enter name, rank, organization, and office symbol and signature of

         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1, when
         instructor certified events become core mission events, or when a higher certification
         is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
         applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
         substandard performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification: line out the event, date and
         certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Discretionary Decertification‖
         under Training Requirement/Subject Title; enter date of decertification under Date
         Completed; enter name, rank, organization and office symbol of the decertifying
         official under Certifying Official/Organization. NOTE: For decertification due to
         loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: line out the event, date and
         certifying official/organization/location; annotate ―Renamed (new name)‖ under
         Subject Title.
 88                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


          7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
          stan/eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 1381 indicating the new MDS and
          transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.2.2.
   7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
   information for an AF Form 1381 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
   AF Form 1381.
   7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 1381. Units may use a computer-generated AF
   Form 1381 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
   maintained. Computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the Air Force
   e-Publishing web site.
       7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 1381 must be signed IAW paragraph
       7.6.1.2.2.1.
       7.6.6.2. The last signature on a computer-generated AF Form 1381 certifies:
          7.6.6.2.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.6.6.2.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
          generated AF Form 1381.
   7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 1381 procedures/program. Include a list of
   certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
   certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 1381
   are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/DOV has
   been authorized by the squadron commander to sign the last line of an AF Form 1381.

         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1, when
         instructor certified events become core mission events, or when a higher certification
         is obtained making the previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also
         applicable for decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than
         substandard performance.
         7.7.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ―X‖ in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. NOTE:                  For
         decertification due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the
         effective date of decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.7.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―Renamed (new
         title)‖ under Remarks.
         7.7.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         stan/eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.7.1.2.2.
  7.7.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
  7.7.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                     91

      7.7.1.2.2.1, 7.7.3.4, 7.7.4.1, and 7.7.4.2 as applicable.
      7.7.6.2. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
          7.7.6.2.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.7.6.2.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
          generated AF Form 4348.
   7.7.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
   certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
   certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
   are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/DOV has
   been authorized by the squadron commander to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
   signify transcription accuracy IAW paragraph 7.7.1.2.2.1.
7.8. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8/8a accomplished by the aircrew member.
   7.8.1. Data Entry. The sample AF Form 942 is provided to demonstrate the content, not the
   format, of the data presented (see Attachment 5).
      7.8.1.1. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except type of evaluation designations
      in capital letters, use upper and lower case letters.
      7.8.1.2. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
      (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
      specific format standards for such data entry.
      7.8.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those on which
      the qualification levels awarded portions of a combined evaluation are not all the same.
      7.8.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
      any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
      awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
      level.
      7.8.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is filled or ―Z‖ out any unused blocks.
      7.8.1.6. (Added-AMC) The 942 entry will be completed no later than the date the final
      approving officer signs the AF Form 8 for the evaluation completed.

   subject AF Form 8/8a (1, 2, 3 or 3/1).
   7.8.6. MAJCOM Change. A one-line, undated entry containing MAJCOM title will be
   made for each change in the MAJCOM under which an evaluation was administered.
   7.8.7. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
   used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Computer-generated forms must mirror AF
   forms as published on the Air Force e-Publishing web site. Electronic copies of the AF Form
   942 should be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron. If
   electronic backups are normally maintained on removable storage media (e.g., DVD-
   ROM/CD-ROM, external hard drive, floppy disk) or are specifically prepared to facilitate
   transfer of an FEF, file the storage media in Section I of the FEF.
7.9. Flight Evaluation Folders. The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the
history of flying qualification for each aircrew member. The AF Form 8/8a is the source
document used to record and certify the qualification of an aircrew member. A complete history
of the AF Forms 8/8a in an FEF is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 942.
   7.9.1. Maintenance. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF, which
   includes all AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381/4348 (optional; see paragraphs
   7.2 ,7.6), and additional MAJCOM specified items. EXCEPTION: See paragraph 8.4 for PJ
   and CRO evaluation folders.
       7.9.1.1. The FEF must be maintained by a stan/eval functional office - normally in the
       organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
       7.9.1.2. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
       stan/eval function at their assigned stations.
       7.9.1.3. The FEF for personnel in inactive flying status will be maintained with their
       Flight Records Folder (FRF).
       7.9.1.4. FEF maintenance may be further defined in the MAJCOM supplement to this
       instruction.
       7.9.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
       the service of the unit of attachment to document their history of
       qualification/certification.
       7.9.1.6. (Added-302AW) Aircrew FEFs will be kept in a locked cabinet in OG/OGV or
       SQ/DOV.
   7.9.2. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections:
       7.9.2.1. Section I (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms
       1381/4348 (if used); see paragraph 7.2 for use of alternate documentation, MAJCOM
       required items and those items authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g.,
       logs of initial and annual reviews). Section I may contain two tabbed sub-sections, Tabs
       are optional.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                    93


        7.9.2.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top of Tab 1 this section (when tabs are
        used), in chronological order with the most recent on top. Place the AF Form
        1381/4348, if used (or alternate document) or any certifications, qualifications,
        authorizations, and/or cross-references to such documents.
        7.9.2.1.2. Tab 2 (if used) maintain any additional information as directed by
        MAJCOM supplement or paragraph 7.7.2.1.4..
        7.9.2.1.2. (AMC) Special Mission Certifications. A Letter of X’s generated by the
        unit training officer, is the basic source document to provide a current history of each
        individual's flying certifications. Include all certifications not annotated on AF Form
        8 (i.e., formation lead, SIOP certification, flight examiner, initial cadre, nuclear, and
        tactical certifications, etc.). See Attachment 10 (Added) for a sample of Letter of
        X’s.
        7.9.2.1.3. If used, file backup electronic storage media in Section I of the FEF.
        7.9.2.1.4. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual’s flight
        record, a copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
        Flying or Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological
        Training Record, may be filed in this section behind Tab 2.
        7.9.2.1.5. (Added-AMC) Tab 2 --Waivers, and Miscellaneous Information. AF
        IMTs 4025, Aircrew Summary/Closeout Report, are no longer maintained in the
        Flight Evaluation Folder. Maintain waivers in excess of two years for the effective
        period of the waiver. File miscellaneous information (i.e., AF IMT 1042 and AF IMT
        702, Individual Physiological Training Record, etc.) in Tab 2.
        7.9.2.1.5. (302AW) An individual minor discrepancy log will be placed behind Tab
        2 of Section I of the FEF when required.
     7.9.2.2. Section II (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8/8a and Memos for
     Record for all evaluations listed on the AF Form 942 in Section I.
        7.9.2.2.1. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most recent on top.
        Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more mission design aircraft or two
        or more crew positions in the same mission design aircraft will file AF Forms 8/8a in
        chronological order – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
        7.9.2.2.1. (AMC) See Figure 7.5 (Added). Under the AF IMT 942, maintain the
        following tabs, as required. Use AMC IMT 457, Flight Evaluation Folder Tabs. Units
        must establish procedures for maintaining the FEF (e.g., AF IMT 1042, Medical
        Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty) in the unit supplement.

          7.9.2.2.2. Memos for record documenting waivers and extensions are filed on top of
          the affected AF Form 8/8a. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto
          the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
          Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent
          MFRs documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification (see paragraph
          7.8.5.1.1) are filed immediately above the latest affected AF Form 8/8a or, in cases
          where the memo is for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a, in
          chronological order with AF Forms 8/8a. Memos for record become a permanent part
          of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
          or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
          7.9.2.2.3. Memos for record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF
          Form 8/8a will be filed on top of that AF Form 8/8a regardless of date the
          discrepancy is discovered.
          7.9.2.2.4. Memos for record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple
          AF Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
          7.9.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for
          evaluation program management.
   7.9.3. Description of Folders.
      7.9.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
      constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
      7.9.3.2. Standard 2 -inch metal fasteners may be used.
      7.9.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSAN to the inside
      back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
      on the label if required.
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                   95


     7.9.3.4. Folders must bear the ―Privacy Act‖ statement or a ―For Official Use Only‖
     label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder.
  7.9.4. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the annual review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     7.9.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to establish their currency and qualification prior to their first flight.
     7.9.4.1. (302AW) An initial review should be completed in two phases. During the first
     phase, the stan/eval member will collect the FEF and all documentation to establish
     certifications the aircrew member was awarded at a previous assignment or at the FTU.
     For aircrew members on PCS, a marshalling exam should be administered at this time, if
     applicable. During the second phase, the aircrew member will be set up in PEX. This
     includes the creation of AF Form 942 and adding applicable certifications for the letter of
     Xs.
         7.9.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and
         qualification of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable
         documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
         currency and qualification of the aircrew member, the unit maintaining the FEF is
         responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
         7.9.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
         stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review
         the FEF prior to their first flight.
     7.9.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a, AF
     Form 1381, or AF Form 4348 when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and
     completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility period and qualification as
     documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events were accomplished and
     requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8/8a
     contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. AF Forms 1381/4348 will be
     reviewed for correct certification signature and to ensure all previous entries are
     accounted for and are accurate. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM
     supplement.
     7.9.4.2. (302AW) Posting reviews will be annotated by marking the FEF Review
     column on the flight evaluation log.
     7.9.4.3. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit FEFs to confirm
     expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same as
     those listed in the FEFs. The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
     period window established by paragraph 5.2.6.1 unless a more restrictive review period is
     established by the MAJCOM supplement. Document the periodic review IAW unit or
     MAJCOM supplement. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not
     required.
     7.9.4.3. (AMC) Annual Review. Accomplish within 12 months of the initial or
     previous annual review. Document accomplishment with an ―Annual Review‖ and date
96                                 AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


     entry on the AF IMT 942. The initial review entry suffices for the annual review
     requirement.
     7.9.4.3. (302AW) Annual FEF reviews will be accomplished using the AMC/A3V
     ASEV STANDARDS GUIDE. Minor discrepancies should be annotated on a log and
     placed behind Tab 2 of Section I. Verify the accuracy of ARMS dates for AA01, AA21,
     and/or Q003 during this review. OG/OGV or SQ/DOV members will conduct the annual
     review in the member’s birth month.
     7.9.4.4. (Added-AMC) While all AF Form 8 and AF IMTs 942 shall be retained in the
     members FEF, additional information contained in the FEF which is not related to the
     member’s current MDS(s) is considered obsolete. Obsolete documents will be returned to
     the member for their records.
  7.9.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Form 1381, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 942.
     7.9.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on
     qualification/certification.
        7.9.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
        aircrew member are considered major.
        7.9.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
        affected aircrew member are considered minor and include typos, formatting and
        misspellings.
     7.9.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Identified major discrepancies are
     documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected
     AF Form 8/8a/1381/4348, or in chronological order with the AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348
     for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348. An MFR created to
     document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the FEF once the
     information is incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner
     Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments. Memos for record become a permanent
     part of the FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
     or corrected by a later AF Form 8/8a.
     7.9.5.3. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are documented on a
     non-permanent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction.
        7.9.5.3.1. The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization
        of AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381, AF Forms 4348, and aircrew
        member FEFs.
        7.9.5.3.2. Record of minor discrepancies need not reside in the FEF.
        7.9.5.3.3. Any records of minor discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior
        to any permanent change in station or status of the affected aircrew member.
     7.9.5.4. Corrections.
        7.9.5.4.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010                                                    97


         document provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the
         correction.
         7.9.5.4.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be
         altered without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member
         and the contents of Section II of the FEF.
         7.9.5.4.3. AF Form 1381. As a source document, the AF Form 1381 may be
         corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
         document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AF Form 1381
         initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certification’s
         intent, make a new AF Form 1381 entry.
         7.9.5.4.4. AF Form 4348. As a source document, the AF Form 4348 may be
         corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
         document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AF Form 4348
         initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certification’s
         intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
  7.9.6. Transfer of FEF. When custody of the FEF is transferred to a new unit or base:
     7.9.6.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the folder until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the folder.
     7.9.6.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.9.6.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF with
     their FRF to the gaining organization.
     7.9.6.3. (AMC) PCS of Individual. A copy of the latest Letter of X’s will be placed in
     the member’s FEF prior to PCS for record.
         7.9.6.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit.
         7.9.6.3.2. Mail any flight evaluation records not included in the folder at time of
         transfer to the gaining organization with clear identification of the individual
         concerned.
         7.9.6.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy until the gaining
         organization has received the original FEF.
         7.9.6.3.4. If any FEF information is maintained electronically, a suitable storage
         media containing that information will be included with the FEF.
  7.9.7. Disposition of FEF.
     7.9.7.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS).
     7.9.7.2. Outdated certification letters, ARMS products, medical recommendations and
     miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the aircrew
     member for disposal.

8 does not apply to X-prefix Aeromedical Evacuation crewmembers.
8.2. Flight Surgeon.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeon Qualification. Basic initial and periodic flight surgeon qualification
   consists of an open-book examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion
   of the basic examination, flight surgeons will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal
   qualification). MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and MDS-
   Specific flight surgeon requirements. Qualification requirements will be documented on AF
   Form 8/8a. Certification requirements will be documented on AF Forms 1381/4348.
   Qualification and certification, when required, must be accomplished before flight as an
   aircrew member.
   8.2.2. Evaluations. Flight surgeon initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required)
   examinations are considered QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this
   AFI, but may be prescribed in MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.3. Timing of Flight Surgeon Evaluations.
      8.2.3.1. Expiration Date. The required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
      17th month following the month in which the date of the AF Form 8/8a was successfully
      completed.
      8.2.3.2. Scheduling. Schedule the periodic evaluation in the eligibility period (6-month
      period prior to expiration date).
      8.2.3.3. Extended Evaluations. The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of the Flight
      Surgeon periodic evaluation up to three months on a case-by-case basis. Inform
      AFMSA/SGPA. Document extended evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.4.
   8.2.4. Requisite Completion. MAJCOMs may establish requisites for flight surgeons as
   necessary. Requisites from a completed evaluation or an examination used for re-currency
   will not be used for subsequent evaluations. All requisites for scheduled periodic evaluations
   in the eligibility period must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the
   expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
   8.2.5. Grading Policies. An overall qualification level of Q-1 will be awarded upon the
   successful completion of the flight surgeon examination(s).
   8.2.6. Flight Surgeon Failure to Complete an Evaluation Within the Required
   Period. If a flight surgeon fails to complete an evaluation prior to the qualification
   expiration date, the flight surgeon loses the qualification covered by the evaluation. The
   flight surgeon will not fly as a crew member until successful completion of the delinquent
   evaluation.

          9.1.3.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC is lead command for mobility and tanker
          aircraft. HQ AMC/A3V maintains Defense Messaging System (DMS) distribution
          lists. FCIF-type information will be coordinated (within time constraints) with
          user-command staffs. FCIF messages will have specific duration and MAJCOM
          applicability.
       9.1.3.2.4. (Added-AMC) Part C: Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB). OG/OGV manages
       the FCB process to ensure vital information, not otherwise available to aircrews, is
       published and updated. The FCB provides aircrews with FCIF information as a
       general knowledge reference tool and ensures current information is available to
       aircrews away from home station. Review, publish, and consolidate FCBs quarterly
       beginning January of each year. Use HQ AMC/A3V website listing current or
       rescinded FCIF messages. As a minimum, the FCB should contain all outstanding
       (exceeding the unit’s quarterly review) FCIFs. Active duty host units will coordinate
       FCBs with their reserve associate units. Host unit active duty FCBs are applicable to
       their reserve associate squadrons. Also see FCB requirements in the appropriate
       AFI11-2MDS-Specific Volume 3, Chapter 6.
          9.1.3.2.4.1. (Added-AMC) Units are no longer required to send a copy of FCB
          to HQ AMC/A3V. Distribute FCBs as follows: Copy to interested staff agencies,
          subordinate units and other units or personnel, as required. Include the latest copy
          in the FCIF. Include one copy in each unit mission kit. Units determine internal
          requirements (i.e. copy to all aircraft commanders, instructors, etc.).
          9.1.3.2.4.2. (Added-AMC) Publish FCBs in the format shown in Table 9.3
          (Added), Table 9.4 (Added) The FCB is signed by the chief, OGV and approved
          by the OG/CC (or equivalent) and (if applicable) reserve associate OG/CC (or
          equivalent). A consolidated subject index may be used instead of the index shown
          in Table 9.3 (Added). All items in the FCB cite the authority for inclusion, for
          example:

          East. 3. Europe, Baltic, and Russia. 4. Caribbean, Central and South America. Units
          may elect to consolidate common Theater Information (e.g., deployment checklist in
          a fifth folder titled: General Deployment Information.) Tailor contents of the folders
          to the unit’s mission. As a minimum, include Mission/Deployment Checklists,
          Airspace/Airfield Review, Theater Instrument Procedures, Organized Track System,
          Communication/Emergency Procedures, Border Clearance, Flight Planning, Special

   or eliminate specific risks or trends. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures. SIIs
   will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to include Safety
   Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related incidences, trend
   analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with equipment/procedures.
   9.2.2. SII(s) should normally be of limited duration (i.e. not to exceed 90 days) so as to
   maintain the focus. If the situation for which the SII was issued remains, consideration
   should be given to amending current procedures and issuing corrective action via a command
   message or FCIF.
   9.2.3. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the MAJCOM, NAF or unit level.
   9.2.4. MAJCOM/NAF SII(s) will be issued to applicable unit OGVs in a message format
   identifying the following elements: subject/title, unique DTG, specific MDS applicability,
   references (document, SIB, etc) risk and trend details, specific emphasis actions to
   reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that is the SII topic, effective date of rescission, and
   SME/POC for further information.
   9.2.5. Units will place all MAJCOM/NAF issued SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part
   B, for dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.6. All current flight-related MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed
   during flight briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission related SII(s) need only be
   briefed on those missions for which the SII is relevant.
   9.2.7. Current MAJCOM/NAF and unit issued SII(s) will be identified in Flight Crew
   Information Summary (FCIS) attachments. Units that do not publish a FCIS will maintain
   current SII(s) in Part B of their FCIF until rescinded.

       9.3.1.6. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B and C (Note: Part C is optional)) items.
   9.3.2. Units will define and publish their positive control system in the unit supplement to
   this instruction.
   9.3.2. (302AW) The 302 OG positive control system for Go/No Go includes the schedulers,
   SARM, orders approving officials, operations supervisors, and aircraft commanders.
       9.3.2.1. (Added-302AW) Schedulers will use PEX to verify training, stan/eval, and
       DNIF status prior to placing a crewmember on a flying line. PEX will be set-up to
       provide a red dot for No Go (grounding) items and a yellow dot for priority 1 (supervised
       status) items. Schedulers will B-Code or I-Code non-current/non-mission ready
       crewmembers when they will be performing those duties they are non-current or non-
       mission ready for and will schedule them with an instructor.
       9.3.2.2. (Added-302AW) SARM personnel will use the ARMS database to verify PEX
       data, verify aeronautical order status, and print the flight authorizations. Supervised
       status will also be identified by stan/eval via a stan/eval notification checklist for testing
       or check ride discrepancies.
       9.3.2.3. (Added-302AW) Orders approving officials will reference the PEX Go/No-Go
       display when signing orders. Operational Risk Management measures will be taken to
       ensure crew mix and mission complexity will ensure success of the mission.
       9.3.2.4. (Added-302AW) Operations supervisors will ensure crewmembers are not
       grounded, properly supervised if required, and current on FCIF and Boldface based on
       PEX and the Boldface manual tracker. If PEX is not available the member will document
       the latest FCIF number on the orders.
       9.3.2.5. (Added-302AW) Aircraft commanders will initial the orders after each
       crewmember has verified their status/duty position and initialed next to their name. ACs
       will approve any changes to the orders and notify squadron DO/ADO of any changes to
       crew complement. ACs will ensure local or AMC web-based ORM is completed prior to
       each day of flying.
   9.3.3. (Added-AMC) Operational Risk Management. All units under the command and
   control of 618 TACC will utilize the standard Aviation ORM worksheet to analyze
 114                                  AFI11-202V2_AMCSUP_302AWSUP_I 31 JULY 2010


   associated risks for all 618 TACC directed missions. This worksheet will be integrated into
   the Go/No Go process. OGV’s will maintain a hard copy of the worksheet for a period of 3
   months.
       9.3.3.1. (Added-AMC) The Fatigue and Stress Scorecard will be posted in the back of
       all crewmembers checklists.
       9.3.3.2. (Added-AMC) ORM worksheet completion will be IAW Chapter 7 of AMCI
       90-903. The Fatigue and Stress Scorecard will be posted behind the last guide in
       crewmember’s checklists.
9.4. Electronic Data Storage. Units may use electronic database files for record keeping, trend
analysis, printing of standard forms, etc. MAJCOMs will establish standards for archiving and
inspection of electronic files. Units not in compliance will maintain hard-copy records as

                     FLIGHT CREW INFORMATION FILE TEMPLATE

Note: The information below is an example of a template MAJCOMs may use when drafting an
FCIF item.
FROM: HQ AFSOC HURLBURT FLD FL//A3V//
TO:     16 OG HURLBURT FLD FL//CC/OGV//
        58 OG KIRTLAND AFB NM//DO/OGV//
        106 OG GABRESKI APRT NY//CC/OGV//
INFO: HQ AFRC ROBINS AFB GA//A3/A3V//
        NGB WASHINGTON DC//A3/A3OT//
        HQ AETC RANDOLPH AFB TX//A3/A3FV//
SUBJECT:         The Subject Line contains the FCIF number and title of the FCIF item (if
applicable)
REF A: Reference A is a location the FCIF reviewer can reference any other material, whether it
is a message or another FCIF item, pertinent to the FCIF entry. If more than one reference is
needed, use REF B, C, etc.
       1.   Applicability paragraph. This paragraph lists the MAJCOM(s) that the FCIF item is
            applicable to, lists the MAJCOM(s) that will retransmit the FCIF item and those
            MAJCOMs for which the FCIF item is ―for information only.‖
       2.   Directive paragraph. FCIF authors will use this paragraph to give direction to aircrews
            regarding procedures or guidance. This information will be placed immediately
            following the applicability paragraph in order to ensure a consistent place for new
            procedures or guidance.
       3.   Amplification paragraph. This paragraph should focus on background information to
            the aircrews or any other amplifying data deemed necessary by the FCIF item author
            for aircrews to understand the impetus behind the FCIF item. The FCIF item should be
            limited to one or two pages in length. Additional supporting background
            documentation should be included in attachments or references.
            a.   Amplifying data may be organized into subparagraphs or follow-on paragraphs.
            b.   If follow-on paragraphs are used, ensure paragraphs are numbered correctly.
       4.   Administrative paragraph. Use this paragraph to show where the FCIF item is to be
            placed (Part B or C), and how for long the FCIF item is to remain in effect. Other
            items of an administrative nature may also be placed in this paragraph.
       5.   Receipt/POC paragraph. This paragraph directs units to acknowledge receipt of the
            FCIF item within a desired period of time, FCIF item POC(s), and the POC phone
            number and email address.

                 RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A9.1. General. The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of
recommended changes to Air Force flying-related publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (covering completion of the form). Submit
recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to
correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF
Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF
publication OPR.
A9.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined inFigure
   A9.1 and in compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will
   utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will
   submit AF Forms 847 electronically to the maximum extent possible.
   A9.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847,
   ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review,
   forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the
   preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent
   of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels below (including the
   originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level and the originator
   advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A9.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A9.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A9.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original
   AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs,
   but may be forwarded for additional considerations if desired. MAJCOMs may address how
   to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR
   in their supplement to this instruction.

   A9.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the
   stan/eval function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no
   requirement to track receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.
   A9.2.7. (Added-302AW) The AF Form 847 program will be executed at the OG/OGV
   level. SQ/DOV or individual aircrew members can originate recommended changes to AFIs
   or T.O.s on an AF Form 847 or a locally produced worksheet. Aircrew members submitting
   proposals will include any supporting references necessary to justify the change. OG/OGV
   will maintain a control log to track the status of all submitted forms and ensure follow-up and
   SEB reporting.
