SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Interim Change 2 implements DoD Directive 5205.15E, DoD Forensic Enterprise, which
establishes policy and assigns responsibilities within the DoD to develop and maintain an
enduring, holistic, global forensic capacity to support the full range of military operations
(ROMO). The DFE consists of those resources, assets, and processes that provide forensic
science analysis linking persons, places, things, and events. These linkages are made in both
traditional law-enforcement and medical purviews, as well as in the expeditionary environment.
The DFE supports numerous customers, including military criminal investigators, medical
examiners, joint force commanders (JFCs), and criminal-intelligence and intelligence analysts. It
establishes the Forensic Executive Committee (EXCOM) to coordinate the activities of the DFE.
It further designates the Secretary of the Air Force as the DoD EA for Digital and Multimedia
Forensics for those forensic disciplines relating to computer and electronic device forensics,
audio forensics, image forensics, and video analysis. Margin bar indicates newly revised
material.
