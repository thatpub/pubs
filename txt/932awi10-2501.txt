1. Wing Emergency Management Office. The Wing Emergency Management Program is
managed by the Readiness and Emergency Management Air Reserve Technician (ART) for the
932 AW/Commander. This office provides the wing with the following:
     1.1. Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). SAVs will be conducted annually and in accordance
     with (IAW) guidance provided by AFI 10-2501 to all subordinate units and performed as
     prescribed by the Emergency Management (EM) Wing SAV Checklist. Each unit will use
     the same checklist to conduct semi-annual self-inspections as well as quarterly EM reports.
     1.2. Training.
        1.2.1. All personnel that require Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and
        Explosive Defense Awareness (CBRNE) , AF Counter – Improvised Explosive Device
        (C-IED) and CBRNE Defense Survival Skills training assigned to the 932 AW will
        receive training IAW AFI 10-2501. CBRNE Defense Awareness and C-IED are
        computer based training courses conducted via the Advanced Distributed Learning
        System (ADLS). CBRNE Survival Skills is conducted by hands-on classroom training.
        An updated CBRNE Training Status Report will be provided to unit Emergency
        Management Representatives (EMR) each month.
        1.2.2. The CBRNE Defense Awareness and C-IED computer based training (CBT) are to
        be taken every 24 months. Both are a prerequisite to the CBRNE Defense Survival Skills
        course.
        1.2.3. CBRNE Survival Skills training will only be taken by those individuals who are
        hard tasked to deploy. NOTE: Aircrew personnel will complete both the CBRNE CBT
        and Survival Skills training IAW applicable career field guidance.
        1.2.4. The CBRNE Defense Task Qualification Training (TQT) program is a unit
        commander program. Training is conducted while wearing the ground crew ensemble
        (GCE) and is performed by all mobility assigned personnel as described in AFI 10-2501,
        para. 6.6.1.13.
            1.2.4.1. During exercises, members MUST perform CBRNE defense TQT tasks to
            receive credit. Mere participation in exercises does not qualify for CBRNE TQT.
            1.2.4.2. Units will document the tasks performed for record on AF Form 1098,
            Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.
            1.2.4.3. The CBRNE TQT program will be reviewed for compliance by the 932d
            Readiness and Emergency Management Flight during local SAVs.
            1.2.4.4. Members perform TQT by accomplishing their duty requirements in a
            wartime environment while wearing the complete ground crew Individual Protective
            Equipment (IPE) or aircrew IPE. Individual Career Field Education Training Plans
            (CFETP) can be used as guidance to identify Air Force Specialty specific skills that
            are core wartime tasks.
        1.2.5. Training for primary and alternate Emergency Management Representatives will
        be provided IAW guidance in AFI 10-2501.
        1.2.6. Status of equipment and training will be provided to all assigned unit commanders
        annually.
