PURPOSE
This Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-42.2 publication
describes a theory and philosophy of casualty prevention for expeditionary operations.
This document provides commanders guidance to implement effective casualty
prevention strategies for expeditionary operations. It represents a firm commitment by
the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) to protect personnel from the hazards described
above.

APPLICATION
This publication applies to all Air Force military and civilian personnel (including Air
Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units and members). The doctrine in
this document is authoritative but not directive. Therefore, commanders need to consider
not only the contents of this Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD), but also the various
issues relating to the particular situation in which they find themselves—national security
objectives, forces available, enemy capabilities, rules of engagement—when
accomplishing their assigned missions.

SCOPE
The AFMS must be able to rapidly respond to the full-spectrum of mission requirements.
This document provides airmen information on the overarching principles, processes,
procedures, and organizational framework through which the AFMS plans, directs, and
executes casualty prevention for expeditionary operations. Ensure that all records created
by this publication are maintained and disposed of In Accordance With (IAW) Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, “Records Disposition Schedule.”

                                       Chapter 1

                                  INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview.

   1.1.1. Force Protection (FP) is a collection of activities that deter, detect, mitigate,
   or negate threats or hazards to Air Force interests, which prevent or detract from
   mission accomplishment. The AFMS largely contributes to FP through Force Health
   Protection (FHP). FHP is a total life-cycle health support system that addresses
   health-related threats affecting combat forces and the supporting community before,
   during, and after deployment. Three central pillars support FHP: Healthy and Fit
   Force, Casualty Prevention, and Casualty Care and Management. The ability of the
   Air Force to conduct sustained combat operations is dependent on the resilience of
   the human weapons system. When the human weapons system is injured or becomes
   ill, operations suffer a decrement and additional resources are required to manage the
   casualty and replace the asset. Air Force Medical Service casualty prevention
   activities are aimed directly at supporting sustained combat operations by
   preserving our most valuable asset: highly skilled and trained personnel.

   1.1.2. This TTP provides guidance to medical commanders and personnel on the
   prevention against the full spectrum of health threats facing today’s forces while
   conducting expeditionary operations. This chapter lays out the basic principles of
   casualty prevention followed by Roles and Responsibilities in Chapter 2. The next
   three chapters discuss casualty prevention for expeditionary operations through the
   phases of pre-deployment, deployment and re-deployment, followed by a section on
   information management. Finally, Chapter 7, Education and Training lists some of
   the essential courses that help commanders and others understand and implement
   effective casualty prevention.

1.2. Casualties. Casualties are personnel unavailable for duty due to illness or injury.
The types of casualties are Disease/Non-Battle Injuries (DNBI) and Battlefield
Injuries/illnesses (BI). (See Figure 1.1). Both have operational relevance, as any
casualty is a reduction in the availability of our most valuable asset. DNBI is largely a
result of our own actions (or inaction), while BI is a direct or indirect consequence of
enemy actions. Historically, DNBI has accounted for 60 to 90 percent of the casualty
total. However, with our enemies’ predicted use of asymmetrical threats such as
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE), our
direct BI rates may increase. Indirect BI (unexposed anxious personnel) may overwhelm
medical treatment facilities and dramatically reduce combat effectiveness if not
effectively managed-- AFMS has a role in preventing both types of casualties. AFMS
also has a role in identifying and preventing delayed casualties. Delayed casualties are
those casualties whose symptoms may not be immediately apparent or whose symptoms
do not manifest for weeks, months, or even years after initial exposure or injury. For
example, victims of Gulf War Syndrome would be considered delayed casualties.

                                 DNBI




1.3. Sources of Casualties. To ensure AFMS addresses the total health risks to an individual
and assists commanders in instituting appropriate risk mitigation strategies, we must establish a
working model of the human weapons system environment. The health hazards that affect the
human weapons system can be reasonably categorized into three areas: hazards associated with
where the force deploys (Force Environment), hazards generated by what the force is doing (Force
Activities), and hazards generated by the enemy (Attacks on the Force). When any of these hazards
align with human weapon system vulnerability, there is a viable risk and casualties may result
(Figure 1.2).

and casualties becomes clear. In practice, force environment and force prevention
activities support the prevention of DNBI (Figure 1.3). The ultimate goal of preventive
medicine activities is to improve mission effectiveness by reducing/eliminating both
battlefield illness/injury and Disease Non-Battle Injuries (DNBI). This model is
applicable to both garrison and expeditionary operations; only the proportion of the total
health risk on an individual from any single component changes. An effective balance of
preventive medicine activities based on a view of total health risk is required to achieve
the ultimate goal of ensuring the force is available to prosecute the nation’s wars.

1.5. Operational Risk Management (ORM). Throughout this document the principles
of ORM are used to give commanders and planners a framework to determine how to
balance risk and mission in terms of casualty prevention. It is useful to visit the concepts
of ORM as outlined in AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk Management. One way to look at
ORM is the use of a matrix (Figure 1.5). The matrix has two axis, severity and
probability. If we assign a severity and probability rating to a particular hazard, we can
then give it a risk level on a scale of low to extremely high. The ORM method is valuable
because it gives us a relatively simple risk assessment methodology that is in the same
language as all other force protection vulnerability assessments, thus lending credibility
to the medical commander.

1.6. Conclusion. The remainder of this TTP is devoted to providing the optimum
medical force employment and planning considerations to ensure the full spectrum of
hazards facing Air Force personnel are identified, vulnerabilities evaluated, and
appropriate risk mitigation strategies are advocated to the command structure. Specific
actions are required during each phase of the deployment cycle in order to minimize Air
Force casualties.

                         ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Overview. Many elements contribute to force protection and casualty prevention.
This section describes these elements as well as the linkages between Line of the Air
Force and Health Service Support (HSS) assets. Commanders at all levels have the
responsibility for protecting Air Force personnel. Command and control structures
should enable commanders to rapidly and effectively address passive defense issues and
quickly react to force protection threats with active defensive or offensive operations.
The overarching nature of the force protection effort requires it be coordinated and
integrated at the highest levels and across all functional areas (see AFDD 2-4.1, Force
Protection for further guidance). AFMS personnel identify potential health threats,
develop courses of action, and advise commanders of the risks and countermeasures.
Commanders must decide how they will use the advice to ensure their units carry out the
actions required (refer to Force Health Protection J-4 Publication.)

2.2. Command Relationships.

   2.2.1. The Secretary of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force working
   through the Chief of Staff of the Air Force exercises control over force protection
   programming, training, staffing, manning, and developing force protection policy.
   The Air Staff’s primary function lies in allocating additional forces and funding as
   needed to fulfill force protection requirements. (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).

   2.2.2. Major Command (MAJCOM). MAJCOM commanders should integrate
   force protection requirements into every aspect of their activities. They should
   authorize cross-functional coordinating bodies to establish guidance, program, and
   manage all force protection requirements for the MAJCOM, and to coordinate with
   the Air Staff. (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).

   2.2.3. Numbered Air Force (NAF). The NAF provides representation to the
   MAJCOM cross-functional staffs for force protection and input on requirements to
   their MAJCOM force protection focal point. (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).

   2.2.4.     Air Force Forces (AFFOR).            A Commander, Air Force Forces
   (COMAFFOR), will serve as the commander of Air Force forces assigned or attached
   to a joint force. A combatant command-aligned NAF is typically re-designated as the
   AFFOR (e.g., 9th Air Force serves as US Central Command Air Forces). This
   organizational structure may be tailored by the COMAFFOR to fit specific mission
   needs. This staff does not exercise direct control over casualty prevention activities,
   but serves a planning, coordination, and oversight role. The combatant commander of
   the AOR is responsible for force protection OCONUS. Centralized control of force
   protection resources and decentralized execution of force protection measures
   are essential to effectively protect our forces against each threat. (AFDD 2-4.1,
   Force Protection).
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                            10



   2.2.5. Wing. Wing commanders face three major force protection challenges:
   planning for force protection integration and support as tasked in applicable
   operational plans, training for force protection, and providing force protection for
   those interests within their purview. Air and Space Expeditionary Wings (AEWs)
   have the added responsibility of accomplishing force protection planning for the units
   identified to deploy to their location during contingency operations. Wing
   commanders should integrate force protection personnel into their organizations to
   establish guidance, program, and manage force protection requirements for the wings.
   Wing commanders should also appoint a single force protection focal point, usually a
   Force Protection Working Group, that should be trained and fully versed in force
   protection issues and methodologies (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).

2.3. Health Service Support (HSS) Assets. All AFMS assets potentially play an
important role in casualty prevention. This section discusses some assets in casualty
prevention.

   2.3.1. Air Force Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG). The AFFOR/SG is a member of
   the COMAFFOR special staff and is the director of USAF health service operations.
   The AFFOR/SG is responsible for overall health resources management and provides
   information on health surveillance, risk assessments, sustainment, and other casualty
   prevention protection issues. AFFOR/SG will ensure preventive medicine personnel
   are integrated into all aspects of force planning.

   2.3.2. Deployed Medical Commander (DMC). The DMC is the commander of the
   deployed HSS assets and is responsible to the AEW commander for HSS of the
   deployed population. The DMC oversees health and injury/illness prevention
   activities and communicates health risks to the AEW commander. The DMC
   communicates and coordinates with the AFFOR/SG on theater medical support issues
   and with other joint and combined medical units at the location. The DMC should
   report DNBI and BI rates to the AFFOR/SG as well as medical intelligence and
   health risk information gathered at the deployed location.

   2.3.3. Preventive and Aerospace Medicine (PAM) Team. The PAM team consists
   of Aerospace Medicine Specialists, Public Health (PH), Bioenvironmental
   Engineering (BE), flight medicine personnel, and Independent Duty Medical
   Technicians (IDMTs). The team oversees basic education and training to prevent
   disease and briefs commanders on actual threats, safety issues, current illness, and
   current health trends. The PAM team leader should be considered the functional
   expert in casualty prevention. The team consists of 3 unit type codes, which can
   deploy both in phases and simultaneously.

        2.3.3.3. Flight Medicine. The Aerospace Medicine Specialist (AMS) serves as
        the team leader and integrates/directs all aspects of the PAM team. They
        additionally provide direct health care to flyers and special operations
        personnel. They also prescribe prophylaxis/pretreatments, evaluate health
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                              11


        screenings, conduct medical maintenance of human weapon systems, and have
        oversight of human factor issues (i.e., training and implementation, crew
        resource management, and counter fatigue).

        2.3.3.2. Public Health (PH). PH officers serve as Medical Intelligence
        Officers (MIO). They develop the medical threat estimate and coordinate
        preventive medicine activities for subject matter experts and medical providers.
        Specifically, PH oversees food safety/security surveillance, communicable
        disease control, occupational health education, insect and vector monitoring and
        control, immunizations policy, as well as enhanced surveillance activities. PH
        also monitors disease trends for indications of overt or covert use of biological
        warfare agents.

        2.3.3.3. Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE). BE personnel spearhead
        causality      prevention       in     the     force   environment      through
        occupational/environmental surveillance of force activities. BE personnel
        perform an Environmental Health Site Assessment (EHSA) to prevent
        causalities related to the force environment. BE personnel, as the Nuclear,
        Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Medical Defense Officer (MDO), prepare the
        environmental portion of the medical threat estimate, perform NBC and water
        vulnerability assessments, and recommend operational solutions that minimize
        the adverse effects of NBC attacks on the force (working with Civil Engineering
        personnel). BE personnel, in consultation with other health-related subject
        matter experts, are experts in the health risk assessment of occupational and
        environmental hazards to include Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
        Nuclear (CBRN) hazards. Specifically, BE personnel are trained to recognize
        these threats, assess the risk to the force, and recommend measures to mitigate
        or control these hazards

        2.3.3.4. Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT). The IDMT
        provides aerospace medicine support, primary care, initial site survey, and
        limited environmental monitoring for water and food safety, field sanitation,
        pest/vector control, sewage, and heat stress to units.

 2.3.4. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield Explosive
 (CBRNE) Assets. In high threat environments, the PAM team is supplemented by the
 Medical NBC Team, Biological Augmentation Team and Air Force Radiological
 Augmentation Team.        (See AFTTP 3-42.3, Health Service Support in NBC
 Environments for further information.)

 2.3.5. Medical Global Reach Laydown Team (MGRL). The MGRL team is similar
 to the first increment of the PAM team. The MGRL provides temporary, time sensitive
 advance team activities for Air Mobility Command (AMC) installations, but is replaced
 by a PAM team within two weeks. That is, the MGRL team provides HSS for AMC’s
 strategic airlift, rather than to the geographic combatant command. The MGRL should
 relay all casualty prevention-related information to the next casualty prevention asset or

 Unit Type Code (UTC) to arrive at the site.

 2.3.6. Life Skills. Life Skills offers preventive interventions for individuals and units--
 stress management, counseling services, command consultation, risk communication,
 spouses’ support network, personnel input into rest and relaxation policies and
 schedules, and critical incident stress debriefings. In deployed settings, Life Skills will
 operate an outpatient mental health clinic. These services include mental health triage,
 management of combat/traumatic stress, and psychopharmacological services (most
 Life Skills providers will not have prescription authority).

2.4. Other Air Force Assets.

   2.4.1. Civil Engineering (CE). CE plays a key role in establishing and operating a
   base (utilities, base laydown, pest control and other functions) as well as CBNBE
   passive defense. Close coordination with CE Operations and Readiness Flights is
   required to ensure casualty prevention concerns are taken into account.

   2.4.2. Intelligence. Intelligence plays a vital role in force protection as the primary
   collection and dissemination point of intelligence. HSS commanders, MIOs and
   MDOs should establish relationships with the local intelligence division, Armed
   Forces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC), and/or Area of Responsibility (AOR)
   sources, as appropriate, and ensure they are receiving regular updates. It is especially
   important that commanders, the MDO and MIO have appropriate security clearances
   in order to access the appropriate intelligence information.

   2.4.3. Public Affairs. Public affairs can be a critical asset in disseminating
   information and dealing with the media. It is essential that commanders engage with
   public affairs at the earliest possible time prior to deployment, but never give media
   interviews without notifying public affairs. . Public affairs aids in casualty
   prevention by providing accurate, appropriate, and timely information to the public.

   2.4.4. Chaplain Services. Spiritual counseling and support from the chaplain
   service is another preventive intervention to reduce the threat of combat and
   operational stress reactions.

   2.4.5. Services. Air Force services personnel provide a critical role both in garrison
   and deployed. They manage food service operations, food security, billeting, and
   mortuary affairs and oversee Morale, Welfare, and Recreation services.

   2.4.6. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). AFOSI monitors local
   activity of groups and individuals. They provide a liaison with local law enforcement
   functions to aid in investigation of events that may be covert actions.

   2.4.7. Force Protection Working Group is a senior level group involving Wing
   Staff Agencies (Public Affairs, Chaplain, Safety, Judge Advocate), Medical Group,
   Mission Support Group (Security Forces, AFOSI, CE), Operations Group
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                              13


   (Intelligence) and Maintenance Group. This group evaluates force protection threats
   from a variety of sources and prioritizes assets to reduce vulnerability. This includes
   a coordinated risk assessment and communication strategy.

   2.4.8. Family Support Activities. It is important to communicate accurate
   information to families in preparation for, during and after a deployment as much as
   is feasible. This will serve to eliminate fears and promote a sense of safety amongst
   those family members and active duty members remaining in garrison. Casualty
   prevention efforts are compromised when the deployed member’s family
   decompensate and/or exhibits dysfunction. In order to assist with minimizing mission
   compromise, active duty members must feel certain that their family members are
   being taken care of and that all is well on the home front.

   2.4.9. Air Force Institute for Operational Health (AFIOH).

        2.4.9.1. Deployed Site Support. AFIOH maintains a number of readily
        deployable highly specialized expert teams capable of supporting AFFOR/SG
        for any CBRNE incident.          The expertise covers the full spectrum—
        epidemiology, radiological, laboratory, environmental, and occupational health.
        In addition, the array of consultants can support field study requirements as
        necessary.

        2.4.9.2. Reachback. AFIOH provides chemical and radiological analytical
        laboratory services. The institute is responsible for receiving and analyzing
        deployment health and environmental surveillance data as well as providing
        reports to all decision makers, from the field unit level to higher headquarters
        staff throughout the Department of Defense (DOD). AFIOH also serves as a
        long-term repository for deployment health and environmental data from Air
        Force operational sites. Occupational, environmental, and radiological health
        risk assessments are readily available as is specialized team training.
        Additionally, AFIOH will provide expert consultation on all CBRNE issues to
        include the specialized detection equipment.

   2.4.10. Security Forces. Security Forces defend air bases by protecting personnel,
   resources, and information from threats that could destroy, damage, or compromise
   the capability of the Air Force to perform its assigned missions. Security forces along
   with the Services Agency (SVA) are responsible for food security (see Air Force
   Instruction (AFI) 10-246 [Draft] Food and Water Protection for further guidance on
   this issue).

   2.4.11. Host Nation/Other Services. HSS is greatly enhanced by its ability to
   cooperate with host nations. Host nation civilians and military personnel have
   invaluable information on indigenous diseases, local hazards and other health risks.
   AFMS personnel cooperate with host nations through programs such as the
   International Health Specialists program. These specialists are well prepared to
   interact with host nations to prevent and if necessary, treat casualties. Other services

   also have experience and medical intelligence that can assist in preventing casualties.
   American embassies can provide invaluable information and some assistance in
   casualty prevention efforts.

                                   PRE-DEPLOYMENT

3.1. Overview. Pre-deployment casualty prevention is a broad area that encompasses a
wide range of activities during a potentially lengthy period of time. Properly conducted
pre-deployment casualty prevention efforts are critical to successful deployed operations.

3.2. Intelligence Gathering. Casualty prevention, a force-multiplying tool for
commanders, is essential throughout the entire health cycle of deployed operations. The
actions and activities taken during the pre-deployment phase are time sensitive and
cannot always be reproduced later in the cycle of the deployment. For these reasons,
commanders at every level must ensure the appropriate pre-deployment measures are
administered before leaving home station. These activities are key to the successful
execution of deployment operations and the prevention of DNBI and BI.

   3.2.1.           Identifying      Preventable       Threats      and      Implementing
   Countermeasures/Infectious Disease Prevention. Identification of preventable
   threats is a cross functional skill set involving base level organizations (local Medical
   Treatment Facility [MTF], Combatant Commander Staff Agencies, Intelligence units
   and support agencies such as the AFMIC, Central Intelligence Agency, host-nation
   American Embassy, and the National Imaging and Mapping Agency). Every effort
   must be made to include all relevant sources to consider both naturally occurring
   threats as well as manmade threats, particularly those posed by an enemy and or non-
   conventional adversaries such as terrorists. Use prior food and water vulnerability
   assessments, after action reports and other timely data at the deployed location to
   further develop the appropriate assessment and countermeasures. Once all
   information is assembled, the MIO, in consultation with subject matter experts will
   develop the medical estimate and countermeasures.

   3.2.2. Determine Need for Additional Data in the Theater of Operations. The
   repository of health related intelligence is extensive, but during pre-deployment
   planning, it may become apparent that there is insufficient medical intelligence for a
   comprehensive Medical Estimate. For this reason, planning should include evaluating
   the need to send advance specialized teams to gather data on the specific location of
   the deployment. Planners must understand that due to the time criticality of
   operations, casualty prevention decisions may have to be made before these theater
   level teams can assess the most current information. Commanders may have to
   employ the ORM strategy using available information and be prepared to make
   adjustments.

3.3. Pre-Deployment Activities.

   3.3.1.         Determine Appropriate Medical Surveillance System and
   Documentation Systems. Prior to deployment, it is critical for commanders and
   planners to determine the appropriate surveillance systems. Future decisions and
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                           16


   adjustments are made based upon accurate data. Selecting the appropriate
   surveillance system becomes crucial. Commanders should develop surveillance
   systems that are redundant, reproducible, actionable and timely. Such systems will
   include Global Expeditionary Medical System (GEMS) and Medical Report for
   Emergencies, Disasters, and Contingencies to document deployment data and, Global
   Emerging Infections Systems/ Electronic Surveillance System for Early Notification
   of Community-based Epidemics and Air Force Complete Immunizations Tracking
   Application to capture baseline data in garrison prior to deployment.

   3.3.2. Assessing the Health Status of the Force. Only healthy and fit members
   should deploy in support of contingency operations. There is a direct relationship
   between casualty prevention and health status. For this reason, members will be
   evaluated for health status using all available resources. As a minimum, home station
   medical personnel will review the Personal Individual Medical Readiness or the
   Reserve Component Periodic Health Assessment computerized database and
   outpatient medical record and ensure deploying personnel are medically qualified to
   deploy.

   3.3.3.     Immunizations.      Immunizations are provided IAW AFJI 48-110,
   Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis. When vaccines are available to protect
   against a validated disease or Biological Warfare (BW) threat, it is DOD policy
   (DODD 6205.3, DOD Immunization Program for Biological Warfare Defense) that
   personnel will be immunized with sufficient time to develop immunity before
   deployment to threat areas. Investigational New Drug protocols should be followed,
   if applicable. The combatant or theater commander may specify immunization
   requirements for the deployed location that must be followed.

   3.3.4. Chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis for some naturally occurring and
   biological, radiological, and chemical agents are available and will be issued at the
   time of deployment IAW theater policy or issued from bulk storage at forward
   deployed locations. Theater deployers must be trained prior to deployment on the
   proper use of these preventive measures. Examples include nerve agent pretreatments
   and medications for the prevention of endemic diseases such as malaria.

   3.3.5. Medical Estimate Operational Health Risk Briefing. The MIO (or
   designee) will brief deploying forces on the deployed health risk threats including:
   environmental hazards, endemic diseases, hazardous insects, plants, and animals,
   NBC threat, and appropriate countermeasures. MIO guidance found in AFI 41-106,
   Medical Readiness Planning and Training. Medical intelligence is available from
   many sources. The primary source is AFMIC, however, the MIO should also acquire
   and be cognizant of current operational intelligence of the deployment location. The
   medical threat briefing should be provided sufficiently early (ideally at the concept
   briefing, and directly to the troops) to permit deploying troops to pack needed
   clothing and supplies and to take appropriate actions prior to deployments.

   3.3.6. Pre-Deployment Medical Assessment (DD Form 2795, Pre-Deployment
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                              17


   Health Assessment Questionnaire) This assessment must be completed for all
   deployments that meet the DODI 6490.3 definition of a deployment. For the purpose
   of joint health surveillance, a deployment is defined as a troop movement resulting
   from a Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)/combatant command deployment order for 30
   continuous days or greater to a land-based location outside the United States. The
   deployed location does not have permanent US military MTFs and may or may not be
   directly supported by deployed medical forces. Use most current guidance on
   deployment health surveillance as mandated by DOD instructions, JCS memoranda,
   and public law. The medical assessment becomes important during pre-deployment
   planning because the questionnaire establishes the health status of the individual prior
   to leaving home station. Individual health readiness is a key component of casualty
   prevention.

   3.3.7. Classified Material. Casualty prevention often entails dealing with classified
   material. AFMS personnel should ensure personnel have the proper security
   clearances to access the appropriate intelligence. In addition, AFMS commanders
   should consider the need for dedicated classified equipment such as Secret Internet
   Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and Secure Transmission Equipment or Secure
   Telephone Unit-Third Generation. AFMS personnel should also be sensitive to
   changes to intelligence classification. For example, a PH officer may report some
   information to intelligence that is subsequently made classified because of its
   sensitive nature.

3.4. Total Environmental and Occupational Health Pre-Risk Assessment.

   3.4.1. Environmental Threat Estimate. BE and PH should gather intelligence on
   the medical threats associated with operating at the deployed location. Intelligence
   gathering should at least explore the ambient environment (air, soil, water), specific
   location, and availability/suitability/vulnerability of local food and water.

   3.4.2. Potential Threat Identification. MDO and MIO must consider and research
   the ambient threats potentially present at the deployed location and make
   recommendations to the DMC and line commanders to ensure proper resources are
   deployed/in-place and that policies regarding operations and personal
   actions/behaviors are implemented to manage the risk of the hazards.

   3.4.3. Site Specific Environment: There are operational risks associated with living
   and operating from a specific location. The amount of information available varies
   dramatically with the degree of national industrialization.

        3.4.3.1. Potential Threat Identification.

              3.4.3.1.1. Water Sources. The potable water source is critical to
              sustained operations. The primary source of drinking water is typically
              bottled water until the safety of local water resources can be determined.
              Bottled water, however, must also be tested. Local vendors have
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                             18


              attempted to sell “contaminated” bottled water to US forces in recent
              contingencies. Research should be conducted to determine the source of
              local water (well, surface, desalinated seawater) and vulnerability to
              pollution and/or covert contamination. Water treatment options should be
              developed in partnership with CE and an interim drinking water plan may
              need to be in-place. If surface water is to be used, ensure USAF or
              coalition operations do not contaminate potential water sources. (Section
              4.4.2.2. contains further information on Bottled Water sources).

              3.4.3.1.2.    Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs)/Toxic Industrial
              Materials (TIMs). The presence of local activities associated with
              manufacturing, mining, or agriculture can present both DNBI (incidental
              and accidental releases) and BI (enemy action) threats. Efforts should be
              made in site selection to minimize the risk of TICs/TIMs by optimizing
              locations, but often tactics and expediency dictate the use of a location
              where significant risk/threat still exists.

              3.4.3.1.3. Ongoing Operations (Pollution). Ongoing manufacturing and
              mining produces emissions and effluents. The effects of airborne
              contamination are difficult to counter, but the effects should be
              considered. Countermeasures should be developed for water and soil
              contamination.

              3.4.3.1.4. Past Operations (Pollution). For rapid deployments, locations
              of opportunity are often used. These frequently include existing airfields,
              both commercial airports and host nation/seized bases. Commercial
              airports are often in industrial areas with the land occupied by our forces
              adjacent to the airport. The activities and practices of both airfield
              operations or past industrial operations may have contaminated the site.
              This should be researched before deployment, to optimize site selection
              and to serve as the basis for a pre-deployment countermeasures plan.

              3.4.3.1.5. Catastrophic Event. Catastrophic release of TICs/TIMs or
              CBRN agents can be either accidental or a result of enemy action. The
              worst-case scenarios for either are usually equivalent. Given intelligence
              on local manufacturing or TIC/TIM storage/distribution, estimates of the
              effect of such a release can and should be modeled prior to deployment.
              In addition to the sources listed for estimating the threat presented by the
              ambient environment, research any site surveys, historical or National
              Imagery and Mapping Agency images, and work with wing AFOSI to
              access other intelligence sources.

3.5. Deploying Mission Support and Flight Operations (Occupational Health).
Many operations that are conducted while in garrison are similar to those accomplished
in a deployed setting, although there may be differences in facilities, operations tempo,
and other parameters that would impact the overall exposure and risk. Effective risk
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                             19


management strategies for deployed operations should be developed during routine, in
garrison ORM, accounting for potential differences between each working environment.

   3.5.1. Deployed Equipment and Materials. Based on the equipment and materials
   on the UTC of an organization, expected hazards can be identified and assessed. If
   administrative controls are necessary, this should be provided to the
   supervisor/commander for inclusion in training and guidance. If Personal Protective
   Equipment (PPE) is expected to be required for deployed operations, it should be
   included in the appropriate UTC allowance. Supervisors/commanders in consultation
   with BE personnel should consider the unique exposure circumstances presented by
   working with/handling deployed equipment and materials of host-nation origin.
   These considerations should include high asbestos and other TIC/TIM content of
   commonly used terms, which may prompt worker requirements for additional PPE.

   3.5.2. Facilities and Engineering Controls. Activities normally conducted in a
   dedicated facility may be performed on the flightline or in a common use hangar
   when deployed. Additionally, engineering controls available in garrison will likely
   be unavailable in deployed location. These factors may drive the need to use PPE for
   deployed operations when none are necessary in garrison. This need may drive
   equipment, training, and medical monitoring not required in garrison operations.

3.6. Risk Communication. Risk communication involves communication essential to
casualty prevention, and the pre-deployment phase is a prime opportunity to uncover
potential threats and vulnerabilities to the force and suggest preventive solutions. The
HSS community must communicate these potential risks to commanders, supervisors and
personnel pending deployment as well as to outside agencies such as the media.

   3.6.1. Subject Matter Experts. In all cases, the risk communicator should be the
   subject matter expert for transmission of threat, vulnerabilities and recommended
   solutions.

   3.6.2. Risk Communication Plan. For large scale events, develop a risk
   communication plan. The risk communication transmission will provide threat and
   vulnerabilities information and recommend solutions. The plan should be exercised
   as necessary.

   3.6.3. Pre-Exposure Preparation (PEP) Training. PEP training is a preventive
   approach to help individuals prepare for and cope with potentially traumatic events. It
   is useful for anyone facing exposure to a potentially traumatic event and promotes
   optimal performance. First responders should attempt to get this training prior to
   exposure to a traumatic event. This training can be just-in-time training but will be
   included as a separate pre-deployment briefing IAW AFI 44-153, Critical Incident
   Stress Management, attachment 8, whenever other pre-deployment briefings are
   provided.

         3.6.3.1. PEP training emphasizes the normalcy of feeling stress in abnormal
         situations. Training focuses on practice of effective approaches to stress
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                          20


       management and the avoidance of ineffective approaches. The training,
       provided by the Critical Incident Stress Team, is conducted when exposure to
       potentially traumatic events is expected (e.g., body retrieval, or a significant
       disaster with loss of life). Material for conducting pre-exposure preparation
       training is contained in AFI 44-153.

       3.6.3.2. PEP training can also be used to prepare an entire community when a
       potentially traumatic event, such as a mobilization deployment, can be
       predicted.

       3.6.3.3. When PEP training is not possible and when a potentially traumatic
       event has occurred, individuals not directly involved in the event can be given
       general educational meetings alerting them of the normal reactions to trauma.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                                                                          21

4.1. Overview. Casualty prevention is an ongoing activity during all phases of military
operations. In this section, specific casualty prevention steps are given during five phases
of deployment—open the airbase, establish the airbase, operate the airbase, sustainment,
and base closure.

4.2. Key Personnel. IDMTs, Squadron Medical Elements (SMEs), PAM teams, and
MGRL teams are the primary actors during deployment. PAM and MGRL teams are
specifically intended to identify, monitor and prevent DNBI. PAM and MGRL teams
differ in regards to operational control, staffing, and duration; operationally, they are not
interchangeable. The geographic combatant commander has operational control of PAM
teams. MGRLs remain under the operational control of the United States Transportation
Command USTRANSCOM commander.

4.3. Open the Airbase (Site/Airfield Survey). Environmental threats to forces are the
primary concerns during this phase of deployment. The task of opening the base begins
with the site or airfield survey. The survey consists of two phases—Phase I, Initial Site
Assessment and Phase II, Site Layout. Phase I is a reconnaissance mission to determine
site suitability/feasibility. Phase II, Site layout, or bed-down (open the base), planning
occurs after the site has already been chosen for a particular mission. (See Figure 4.1).

   4.3.1. Phase 1-Initial Site Surveys. Normally, COMAFFORs organize and conduct
   initial site surveys. HSS personnel can and should access the latest site survey by
   contacting the geographic combatant command AFFOR/SG representative and the
   USTRANSCOM AFFOR/SG. The timing and scope of site surveys depends on world
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                               22


   circumstances. In the deliberate planning mode, COMAFFORs conduct and
   periodically update site surveys. In the Crisis Action mode, the site survey may occur
   simultaneously with deployment. Team composition depends on the amount of
   information/intelligence that is currently available for the site. HSS has key roles in
   the threat and beddown assessments. Normally, AMS, PH and BE personnel possess
   the best skill sets for health and environmental threat and beddown assessments and
   serve as the HSS members on these teams. The following list details the four
   functions of the initial survey, and the corresponding subject matter experts and team
   members.

        4.3.1.1. Pavements Evaluation – CE.

        4.3.1.2. Airfield Suitability Survey – Airfield Operations.

        4.3.1.3. Threat Assessment – Security Forces, HSS, and AFOSI. HSS
        representative conducts an initial area health threat assessment for endemic
        disease, and initial assessments of local food and water sources. Threat
        assessments also include evaluation of local industries to determine the hazards
        associated with a release of TICs/TIMs during deliberate targeting or collateral
        damage. Host nation industrial hazards can present serious danger to U.S.
        forces if their infrastructure is damaged—either by deliberate targeting or
        collateral damage. They can also pose a less immediate danger if the base is
        downwind or downstream.

        4.3.1.4.   Beddown Assessment – CE, Contracting, Petroleum Oil and
        Lubricants, Munitions/Safety Communications, Logistics Plans, and HSS. The
        HSS Beddown assessment must address the following:

                4.3.1.4.1. Adequacy and Potability of Available Water Sources. Use
                the water consumption planning factors from Air Combat Command
                Field Manual 00-1 “Bioenvironmental Engineering Environmental Field
                Manual” to determine the adequacy of available sources. If possible, the
                survey team should collect source water samples to determine potability.
                HSS personnel should also assess sources of pollution that could impact
                water sources—particularly during a rainy season—such as, landfills,
                agriculture/livestock activities, and industrial and sewage discharge.

                4.3.1.4.2. Drainage and Geology. HSS team members should
                determine if the proposed site is in a flood plain, a natural drainage basin
                or an area with a high water table. To facilitate camp drainage and
                soakage pits, the site should support good percolation. In addition,
                check for large quantities of rock, which will make it more difficult to
                dig latrines, drainage pits and interment sites. Subsoil that consists
                largely of clay or sand will not provide stable building platforms.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                             23


               4.3.1.4.3. Environmental Health Site Assessment. The HSS team
               members should perform as much of the “reconnaissance and interview”
               step as possible during the initial site survey. The team should identify
               “areas of concern” where exposure scenarios are likely, such as when
               there are hazardous/radiological waste burial sites, mine tailings, and
               soil/ground water plumes. This information is part of the “preliminary
               hazard assessment.”

               4.3.1.4.4. Sewage/Waste Disposal. The team should note the
               availability, capacity and condition of any available sewage/waste
               disposal systems.

               4.3.1.4.5.    Local Health Service Support Capabilities. Assess
               capabilities of local PH, mental health and medical care facilities (as
               well as other services in the area) for availability, accessibility and
               standards of care practiced.

               4.3.1.4.6. Food Source Approval. When food sources must be
               procured locally at the deployed location, contracting in coordination
               with services and Public Health will help ensure only approved food
               sources are procured/consumed.

        4.3.1.5. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Capabilities. Determine the ability to
        access tertiary health care in a timely manner, and return injured personnel to
        duty.     Early mobilization of AE assets will improve casualty prognosis.
        Consider distance from tertiary facility and time required for AE to deliver
        casualty under urgent conditions. Critical Care Aeromedical Transport Team
        support will also factor into AE considerations. Also consider airfield/landing
        strip capabilities (fixed wing vs. rotary wing support) and availability of Mobile
        Aeromedical Staging Facility capabilities. Also consider the AE transport needs
        of contaminated and infectious patients. (See AFTTP 3-42.5, Aeromedical
        Evacuation.)

   4.3.2. Phase 2-Site Layout/Advance Team (ADVON). The second phase of the
   site survey is usually conducted by a wing or weapon system ADVON team. The
   survey is for the purpose of bedding down a particular mission or group of forces.
   The beddown plan, which includes site layout, is the primary product of this phase.
   HSS has a vital role in this phase since site layout can have a tremendous impact on
   human health and performance. The team should continue conducting the EHSA,
   along with infectious disease and sanitation evaluation to advise base planners and
   ensure site layout minimizes the number and severity of potential exposure pathways.
   Casualty prevention efforts for the ADVON team include, but are not limited to the
   following:

        4.3.2.1. Water Source Selection and Treatment Requirements. To assist in
        source selection and treatment requirements, HSS personnel (normally BE)
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                         24


       should perform initial screening using available field equipment. Reference
       interim AFMAN 48-138 “Sanitary Control and Surveillance of Field Water
       Supplies” for procedures and maximum contaminant limits.

       4.3.2.2. TICs/TIMs. Location of local industrial facilities and any associated
       air emission plumes may affect base personnel in their work or living
       environments. Information on prevailing wind patterns will help determine the
       best locations for work, dining and living site layout planning. Also consider
       locations of base and local nation Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) storage sites,
       hazardous waste and solid waste disposal sites and other landfill sites when
       planning work, living or dining facilities. As the mission allows, PAM/MGRL
       team members should develop the sampling plan, and collect vital samples to
       assess potential exposure locations.

       4.3.2.3. Billeting And Dining Facilities. HSS personnel should ensure
       billeting and dining facilities are an appropriate distance from lavatories,
       standing bodies of water and other hazards, such as camp boundaries, and
       flightline noise hazards. HSS personnel should also ensure there are an
       appropriate number of lavatories and hand washing units per capita, and that
       hand washing facilities are immediately accessible at lavatories and dining
       facilities. They should also conduct site surveys to ensure conditions are
       appropriate for food storage, and assist CE in designing gray water storage and
       treatment, and septic disposal. HSS should influence site layout to create
       billeting areas conducive to good rest. Consider noise and traffic flow and
       group workers by shifts to minimize interruptions.

       4.3.2.4. Siting Medicine Facilities. Ensuring ease of access and increased
       availability enhances the probability that individuals will seek care when
       appropriate. In determining the location of MTFs consider the proximity to
       primary targets. MTFs should be close enough to work and billeting areas to be
       easily accessed, but distanced to adequately provide noncombatant safety.
       Consider the potential impact of hazardous noise exposure and speech
       interference levels which might interfere with health care delivery. There
       should be an efficient and safe casualty collection/flow across NBC and defense
       sectors. A plan to include tactical communication support or have it located
       nearby will be necessary.

       4.3.2.5. Mortuary Facilities.        In coordination with services personnel,
       PAM/MGRL personnel assist in siting mortuary facilities. In addition, the NBC
       MDO must assist in developing procedures for the temporary interment of the
       deceased contaminated with NBC agents, and physicians must help develop
       procedures for death certificate completion in these circumstances.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                                                                                           25

 4.4. Establish the Airbase.

      4.4.1. Medical Intelligence. Medical Intelligence coordinates with Flight
      Medicine, BE, AFOSI, Wing Intelligence Officer, AFMIC and Higher HQ’s
      personnel to identify new or changing threats and recommend Force Protection
      interventions. Every effort should be made to include all sources of intelligence,
      both operational and medical. The MIO should routinely brief commanders and
      deployed personnel on changes.

      4.4.2. Establishing Safe Water and Food Supplies.

              4.4.2.1. Water Distribution Systems. BE personnel must assist CE in
              determining the treatment requirements and assisting in distribution system
              design.

                        4.4.2.1.1. After drinking water treatment is in place, BE personnel
                        must certify the “finished” water for consumption. Finished water
                        must comply with the maximum contaminant levels in AFMAN 48-
                        138. Normally, these standards will be more stringent than those
                        published in the host nation Final Governing Standards (FGSs), but
                        BE should verify this fact, and strive for compliance with any FGSs.
                        BE personnel may use available field techniques for chemicals, and a
                        presence/absence test for biological contamination to make initial
                        water quality/potability determinations. However, they must submit
                        additional samples to an approved analytical laboratory for eventual
                        verification, and document the laboratory results in GEMs. BE
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                          26


                personnel must also report water monitoring results in accordance with
                the AFFOR/SG directions.

                4.4.2.1.2. CE personnel must sanitize water storage tanks, trucks and
                buffaloes before placing them in operation. Reference Air Combat
                Command Field Manual 00-1, Bioenvironmental Engineering
                Environmental Field Manual for sanitization procedures.           BE
                personnel should verify adequacy of sanitation.

                 4.4.2.1.3. Throughout the selection and design process, BE personnel
                should consider the vulnerability of the water system components to
                natural disaster, sabotage/terrorism and conventional attack. As soon
                as possible, BE personnel conduct a Water Vulnerability Assessment
                (WVA) of the entire system using the Air Force Institute Occupational
                Health (AFIOH) “Water Vulnerability and Risk Assessments for DOD
                Potable Water Assets” [draft] Aug 02. BE personnel will report the
                results of the WVA to the installation force protection working
                group/security council. The Installation Security Council should
                design and implement measures to reduce identified vulnerabilities,
                and track the status of vulnerabilities, periodically.

         4.4.2.2. Bottled Water. Contracting must not locally purchase bottled water
         unless the bottled water is on the DOD Directory of Approved Sources
         maintained by the Army Veterinary Services. If no locally approved source is
         available, an approval inspection of the production/bottling facility is
         accomplished. If an approval inspection is necessary, HSS personnel will
         consult the AFFOR/SG staff, using the appropriate chain of command. The
         AFFOR/SG staff will coordinate the inspection with embassy officials, using
         the appropriate chain of command, so embassy officials can ensure
         compliance with international agreements. If the AFFOR/SG instructs local
         BE personnel to perform the inspection, they should use Military Standard
         3006, Sanitation Requirements for Food Establishments (Army Central
         Command), and test the bottled water prior to consumption. AFMAN 48-138,
         Field Water Surveillance contains testing procedures and maximum
         contaminant limits for bottled water.

         4.4.2.3. Food Procurement. PH personnel should work with the Base
         Contracting officer and US Army Veterinary services (when available) to
         inspect and approve local sources for procurement of food. If US Army
         Veterinary services cannot perform local approval inspection for a food
         source, Air Force PH will perform local approved source inspections and
         maintain a local approved source listing. Routine surveillance of these
         sources will be conducted to ensure a continuous supply of safe food products.

         4.4.2.4. Food Vulnerability. PH personnel should assess the threat of
         intentional contamination to the food supply using available intelligence
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                            27


         sources (i.e., AFOSI data, SIPRNET). These assessments should be part of a
         focused analysis of the installation’s vulnerability and potential mitigation
         measures. Food surveillance should be enhanced with any increased threat.
         Food vulnerability assessments should be coordinated with other applicable
         agencies (services) and updated/reviewed as needed by the force protection-
         working group. Specifically, Services Agency (SVA) will apply Operational
         Risk Management (ORM) techniques to determine the acceptability of
         contracting/hiring host-nation (local) workers to serve as food handlers for the
         installation. In such cases where the decision includes hiring local food
         handlers, SVA will coordinate with SFS and AFOSI on conducting
         background security checks before such individuals are hired and will also
         coordinate with Public Health on food handler training.

    4.4.3. Disease Surveillance. Collect baseline and ongoing disease surveillance
    data to establish disease surveillance to identify covert biological attacks or
    endemic disease outbreaks. Part of baseline data includes maintenance of list of
    deployed personnel to determine rates of disease and illness. Report DNBI as
    outlined in Enclosure C of the JCS Memo, 1 Feb 02, “Updated Procedures for
    Deployment Health Surveillance and Readiness.” PH personnel will ensure
    reportable medical events (Enclosure D, JCS Memo, 1 Feb 02) are reported and will
    conduct epidemiological investigations IAW Air Force guidance and clinical
    indications. PH personnel will coordinate with local health authorities to determine
    local disease patterns and outbreaks. Intercession strategies will be targeted
    according to the disease patterns and outbreak information taken as a whole from
    both DOD and local data. PH will forward information gathered about disease
    patterns and outbreaks through channels to AFMIC (so others deploying to this area
    are aware of updated medical intelligence).

    4.4.4. Planning.

         4.4.4.1. NBC Defense Planning. During this phase of deployment, NBC
         MDOs should coordinate with CEX personnel to establish the NBC
         reconnaissance and detection plan, and evaluate the impact of NBC sectors to
         casualty collection and transport. They should also coordinate with CEX on
         proposed contamination control area sites. (See AFTTP 3-42.3, HSS in NBC
         Environments and AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and
         Conventional Defense Operations and Standards for additional information.)

         4.4.4.2. Disaster Response Planning. PAM/MGRL personnel must
         cooperate with Security Forces, CEX and CEF personnel to develop HSS
         annexes for base response plans, including the base Disaster Response Plan
         and the Base Support plan. In addition to the considerations listed in AFI 10-
         2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response, PAM/MGRL personnel should plan for
         establishing quarantine protocols and areas in the event of an infectious
         disease episode, and caring for civilians, prisoners of war, and/or refugees.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                          28


    4.4.5. Continue EHSA.           PAM/MGRL personnel should update the EHSA
    sampling plan begun in the site layout phase, and collect samples as the mission
    allows. Prioritize sampling on the basis of risk.

         4.4.5.1. Morale, Welfare and Recreation. PAM/MGRL personnel assess
         the health risk of offsite establishments (normally PH) and swimming areas
         (normally BE). These subject matter experts will advise the deployed services
         squadron and Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board.

         4.4.5.2. Define Operational Activities and Exposure Groups. The health
         threat from force activities becomes an emphasis during this phase. To begin
         assessing and controlling this risk, PAM/MGRL personnel should conduct a
         “walk through” to identify, inventory and classify operational activities and
         exposure groups. Exposure groups consist of individuals who will receive
         similar operational and environmental exposures during the course of their
         duties. Activities are operational tasks and processes. Normally, individuals
         in an exposure group perform the same operational tasks and processes. PAM
         personnel will enter this inventory into the Theater Occupational Model
         (TOMs) module of GEMS. PAM/MGRL personnel will categorize exposure
         groups by risk and prioritize them for exposure assessment.

         4.4.5.3. Hazardous Material Management and Disposal. In some
         situations, hazardous materials may be procured locally at the deployed
         location. In these situations, BE personnel must work closely with contracting
         personnel to purchase materials with the lowest degree of associated risk. If
         hazardous materials must be obtained, the supplier should provide the Air
         Force with the constituents of the product at a minimum. Though AFI 32-
         7086, Hazardous Materials Management Program, is intended for “in
         garrison” use, it can serve as a useful guide for ensuring safe management and
         distribution of hazardous materials in deployed settings. The environmental
         and occupational health assessment process, described in the “operate the
         base” section of this chapter includes evaluation procedures for hazardous
         material use. BE personnel must also work with CE personnel to ensure
         potentially hazardous waste is stored safely, and disposal will not adversely
         impact environment.

           4.4.5.4. Accessing Local Medical Care. Establish cooperative local care
           agreements, communications, surveillance standards, terms for health care
           assistance and reimbursement as appropriate, and then maintain liaison with
           these providers.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                                 29

4.5. Operate the Base. Once the site has been established and secured, the HSS
personnel will move into a sustained phase of operations to continue prevention of
casualties. Many of the functions initiated during the beddown period will be maintained
throughout this phase. (See Figure 4.3.)

   4.5.1. Facility Sanitation. PH personnel will conduct routine surveillance of all
   food facilities on base to prevent food borne illness disease and outbreaks. All
   aspects of food safety/security, from the receipt of food to serving of meals, should be
   evaluated. Adherence to the United States Food and Drug Administration Food
   Code, food handler training, and food storage and facility sanitation should be
   monitored and findings entered in the GEMS database.

   4.5.2. Environmental and Occupational Health Assessment.

         4.5.2.1. Occupational Health. BE personnel will evaluate the health threats
         associated with force activities and provide commanders appropriate mitigative
         strategies to minimize risk. Though AFMAN 48-145, Occupational Health
         Program is directed at “in garrison” occupational health surveillance, its risk
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                          30


       assessment process is applicable to deployed settings as well.    BE personnel
       should adhere to AFMAN 48-145 as closely as possible.

              4.5.2.1.1. After completing initial health risk assessments, BE personnel
              should establish a process to routinely review the currency of the health
              risk assessment. Factors which may change the risk assessment include
              changes in force conditions, changes in vulnerability to attack or
              sabotage, change in mission or weapon system, significant changes to
              operations, and turn-over of personnel due to Air and Space
              Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotations.

              4.5.2.1.2. Due to turnover of personnel during AEF rotations, if mission
              allows, routine surveillance of category 1 and 2 workplaces (as
              identified in AFI 48-145, Occupational Health Program) should be
              conducted during each rotation. Emphasis should be placed on ensuring
              conditions are the same as during the previous AEF rotation. When
              possible, this should be done toward the beginning of the rotation.

              4.5.2.1.3. Maintenance of accurate similar exposure group personnel
              rosters is essential for ensuring occupational, environmental, and health
              surveillance exposure data can be linked to each individual’s medical
              record as required by DOD/Health Affairs policy as delineated in DODI
              6490.3.


       4.5.2.2. Environmental Health. The health risk assessment process also
       applies to the interpretation of EHSA and other environmental data. BE
       personnel should continue to execute the EHSA and update the conceptual site
       model as the mission allows. Prioritize sample collection on the basis of risk.

       4.5.2.3. Data Management. GEMS will be used for data management. See
       Chapter 6 for more details. Both acute and chronic health risk information
       should be entered into GEMS. GEMS enables the AFMS to meet the
       requirements in Presidential Review Directive 5 to establish a longitudinal
       health record that includes environmental and occupational health exposures.
       All environmental and occupational health exposures must be tied to an
       individual.

    4.5.3. Available Standards and Guidance.

         4.5.3.1.   AFI 48-145, Occupational Health Program is the primary
         occupational health surveillance guidance. Much professional judgment is
         required to determine applicable occupational and environmental health
         standards and guidelines. Army Technical Guide 230, Chemical Exposure
         Guidelines for Deployed Military Personnel, should be used as a reference for
         occupational and environmental exposure with the following exceptions:
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                         31


                4.5.3.1.1. Do NOT use the chemical agent warfare exposure
                standards; instead use the values posted in AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear
                Biological, Chemical and Conventional Defense Operations and
                Standards, and the procedures established in Chemical Warfare Agent
                Health Risk Assessment interim guidance published by AFMOA for
                assessing health risk.

                4.5.3.1.2. Do NOT use the drinking water guidance; instead use draft
                AFMAN 48-138, Sanitary Control and Surveillance of Field Water
                Supplies.

         4.5.3.2.    The Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document
         (OEBGD) and FGS usually do not apply to deployment locations, although
         they may if forces are deployed at a fixed location. The OEBGD and FGS can
         be used as a guide, as operations allow. Questions on applicability of these
         documents should be referred to the AFFOR/SG.

         4.5.3.3. Other sources of occupational and environmental health standards
         may be used if Army TG 230, Chemical Exposure Guidelines for Deployed
         Military Personnel does not address them. These include occupational
         exposure guidelines established by Air Force Occupational Safety and Health
         (AFOSH) Standard 48-8. A great deal of professional judgment is required
         when applying these guidelines, and BE personnel must ensure they take into
         account operational needs when using them.

    4.5.4. Monitoring and Sampling Plans/Procedures.

         4.5.4.1. BE personnel shall establish monitoring and sampling plans and
         procedures for environmental and occupational health surveillance.

         4.5.4.2. For drinking water, a routine surveillance schedule should be
         established based on ORM principles, and AFMAN 48-138.

         4.5.4.3. When sending samples to other laboratories, ensure a chain of
         custody is established for the samples. If the AFFOR/SG has not established
         procedures, use DD Form 1911, Materiel Courier Receipt.

    4.5.5. Epidemiological Surveillance. PH personnel will conduct disease and
    syndromic surveillance on a daily basis. An effective tool for identifying and
    targeting health hazards is a robust health surveillance and Disease Non-Battle
    Injuries (DNBI) monitoring and reporting system. PH personnel will educate all
    providers on the importance of compliance with the theater surveillance system and
    ensuring accurate patient encounter information.

    4.5.6. Prophylactic Care Monitoring. Preventive programs initiated during pre-
    deployment will need ongoing checks and maintenance supervision. Screen
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                            32


    arriving personnel to ensure they received adequate pre-deployment preventive
    measures, including malaria chemoprophylaxis, prophylactic medications,
    immunizations, and gas mask quantitative fit testing. Correct deficiencies as
    indicated. In addition, monitor storage, and if directed by combatant commander,
    distribution, administration, and the Force Health Protection Prophylactic
    Prescriptions.

    4.5.7. Personnel Health Risk and Prevention Education. Prevention of disease
    and injury is enhanced through persistent education efforts. Threat briefings for all
    personnel and commanders should be a routine process and should at a minimum
    include the following:

         4.5.7.1. Local health threat briefings for all personnel at inprocessing

         4.5.7.2. Additional squadron or unit briefings as threat or need dictates

         4.5.7.3. Wing or Operations Commander Health Status Updates should
         include:

                 4.5.7.3.1. Up-to-date daily and weekly flying Duty Not Including
                 Flying status reports. (Assessment of effect on mission and
                 recommendations as necessary.)

                 4.5.7.3.2. Duty days lost due to DNBI for flying and non-flying
                 personnel. (Assessment of trends, effect on mission and
                 recommendations.)

                 4.5.7.3.3. Off site restrictions/risk assessment

                 4.5.7.3.4. Heat and cold stress procedures, including work/rest cycles
                 and hydration standards.

         4.5.7.4. Injury Susceptibility/Prevention. In addition to the training listed
         above, encourage personnel to apply ORM to activities—both duty-related
         and recreational. Determination of injury risk requires individual risk
         assessment. Personnel should consider pre-existing injuries, activity risk, and
         familiarity with the activities. Provide personnel information about fatigue
         and stress mitigation, and train them to consider these factors.

    4.5.8. Flight Medicine Issues.

         4.5.8.1. Crew Rest. In coordination with the Operations Group Commander
         (or equivalent), establish requirements and restrictions and monitor for
         implementation and adherence to requirements.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                            33


          4.5.8.2. Crew Resource Management. Monitor effectiveness of crew
          resource management by direct observation (flight surgeons) when possible.
          Evaluate, educate, and reinforce through continual training and input to
          aircrew briefings.

          4.5.8.3. Counter-Fatigue Program. Flight Medicine personnel will monitor
          the status of pre-deployment testing for pilots. The Fatigue Avoidance
          Scheduling Tool is useful to monitor operational use of counter-fatigue
          medication (go/no-go pills) administration and usage. The AFFOR/SG will
          likely have specific reporting requirements for go/no-go pill reporting. Flight
          medicine personnel work with commanders to develop work/rest cycles and
          crew rest requirements.

    4.5.9. Detachment Oversight. Monitor detachment IDMT status as indicated.
    Conduct detachment site visits with appropriate frequency to ensure training and
    oversight of medical care provided by IDMTs.

    4.5.10. Reachback Support.

          4.5.10.1. The AFFOR/SG will act as the focal point for reachback support,
          and can provide (or arrange for) technical consultation as well.

          4.5.10.2. If a theater laboratory is established, BE personnel should become
          aware of the laboratory’s capabilities and use the laboratory when local
          analysis is not possible, or additional analysis is required. The laboratory
          should also be used for technical consultation on conducting health risk
          assessments beyond the scope of installation preventive medicine personnel.

          4.5.10.3. If a theater laboratory is not available, the AFFOR/SG will establish
          procedures for using service level organizations such as AFIOH or US Army
          Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM). These
          organizations can also provide technical consultation, and may be called on
          for focused health risk assessments.

4.6. Sustainment.

   4.6.1. Ongoing Activities.

        4.6.1.1. Team Aerospace personnel should continue to routinely review the
        currency of both the occupational and environmental health risk assessments, as
        described in paragraph 4.5.2.1.1. and 4.5.4.1 above. DNBI indicators could also
        initiate additional sampling.

        4.6.1.2. For drinking water, a routine surveillance schedule should be
        established to include random sampling, as an effort to defeat sabotage.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                            34


        4.6.1.3. For air and surface water, (seasonal changes, etc.), enough data should
        be collected to ensure seasonal variations are accounted for. Once a baseline is
        established, additional sampling is not required unless significant changes
        occur.

        4.6.1.4. For soil, there is no need to conduct routine surveillance unless there
        are significant events such as hazardous material spills, discovery of buried
        waste, etc., or other indications.

   4.6.2. Data Management. For most units, GEMS will be used for data management.

   4.6.3. Hazardous Material Management. During the sustainment phase, the
   deployed installation may establish a hazardous material management process. See
   reference AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material Management for more details on the role
   of BE personnel in this process.

   4.6.4. Life Skills Support Center.

        4.6.4.1. Establishment of Life Skills Support Center (LSSC). The
        establishment of the LSSC should be part of risk communication efforts. The
        team will rapidly deploy and set up within 24 hours after arrival. The team
        chief will meet with the DMC upon arrival at the deployed location and
        coordinate an initial meeting (within the first week) with Wing commander via
        the DMC. The team will begin their initial assessment after setup is complete to
        determine the needs of the deployed location and provide this assessment
        information to the leadership. The Life Skills team will serve as a consultant to
        the Wing and Medical Group commanders on the emotional readiness of the
        deployed forces. The team will provide a variety of outreach and prevention
        services, and early detection and intervention services.

        4.6.4.2. Family Support Issues. Recognition of the importance of family or
        personal stressors and their effect on individual performance and safety is
        paramount. Early recognition of these factors may be key in limiting their
        effects. Prevention begins prior to deployment (see Chapter 3) but ongoing care
        of family and individuals’ needs should be supported throughout the
        deployment.

        4.6.4.3. Critical Incident Stress Management. Many types of events have the
        potential to produce individual and community traumatic stress. It is Air Force
        policy to provide Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) preventive
        services to unit and community members whenever possible before potentially
        traumatic events occur. Similarly, CISM services will be provided after
        traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events. In each case,
        the goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal
        stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended to minimize
        the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanent
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                             35


         disability, if possible. The deployed Wing commander is responsible to ensure
         that CISM services are available to deployed personnel.

   4.6.5. Food Laboratory Analysis. PH will develop and refine a food monitoring
   and testing strategy.    Laboratory personnel should ensure chain of custody
   procedures for samples suspected to be from a BW incident. Reports of suspected
   BW events should be made in accordance with AFFOR and theater reporting
   requirements.

4.7. Base Closure/Redeployment. As the base closure/redeployment plan is initiated, it
is important for HSS to assess the effects of the base activities on the local environment
related to possible hazardous exposures and any other health risks identified during the
deployment. Establish continued follow up liaison between HSS and local healthcare
community. Set up avenues for continued cooperative surveillance and reporting of
infectious diseases.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                             36



                                       Chapter 5

                                 RE-DEPLOYMENT

5.1. Overview. Casualty prevention continues to be an important consideration during
re-deployment. Commanders should not underestimate the significant health threats
associated with redeployment.

   5.1.1. Ongoing Activities at the Deployed Medical Element: The DMC needs to
   continue the ongoing health surveillance program. The DMC must ensure post-
   deployment health assessments are completed by all deployers prior to leaving the
   AOR. Instruction on required follow up for exposures and the deployed medical
   record returns with the individual or unit. Documentation of all exposures, medical
   interventions, and use of prophylaxis or antidotes in the individual’s deployed
   medical record is critical. Use of the GEMS is invaluable to maintaining an
   exportable automated record of the individual and collective health events. All
   deployed medical encounter documentation should be printed and placed in the
   deployed medical record for inclusion in the patients permanent medical record at
   home station.

   5.1.2. Completing the Post Deployment Health Assessment (DD Form 2796, Post
   Deployment Health Assessment Questionnaire).

        5.1.2.1. These assessments must be completed for all deployments that meet the
        Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) definition of a deployment.

        5.1.2.2. At the deployed location, a provider (physician, nurse practitioner,
        physician assistant, or IDMT) administers this assessment to all redeploying
        personnel within 5 days of redeployment. All documentation is placed in the
        deployed medical record and is returned to home station by the redeploying
        medical element, troop commander or individual member in the event the
        member does not return as part of a troop movement. Regardless of how the
        deployed medical record returns to home station, it is critical the deployed
        medical element makes sure it returns intact to the Force Health Management
        element of the PH section.

   5.1.3. Continue Surveillance Efforts: Up-channel surveillance data to the DOD
   central data repository as specified in Joint Policy Memorandum on Deployed
   Occupational Health and Environmental Health Surveillance. To the extent possible,
   surveillance activities, both environmental and epidemiological, should continue for
   as long as the potential exists to utilize the deployed location for future operations.

   5.1.4. Redeployment of Equipment and Aircraft: Redeploying equipment and
   aircraft may have special considerations, depending on the environment where the
   assets were used or transited. Any assets used in locations where chemical,
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                            37


   biological, or nuclear weapons (especially dirty bombs) were employed by the
   enemy, will need to be decontaminated before they are redeployed. Additionally,
   equipment or aircraft located in areas where there are indigenous infectious diseases
   that can be carried by equipment or aircraft (to include pests/produce/plant diseases)
   will also need to be decontaminated before they are redeployed.            The AOR
   commander is the proper source for instructions for the redeployment of equipment
   and aircraft.

5.2. Risk Communication. The reconstitution phase of deployment is critical to the
reunification of active duty members with their families. Reunion briefings/classes
should be offered to the family of deployed members prior to their return and to deployed
active duty members prior to their return home. Upon return to home station, the
couple/family should be offered a follow up reunion session along with any children in
the family (see “Communicating in a Crisis: Risk Communication Guidelines for Public
Officials” [2002]), U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Substance Abuse and
Mental         Health        Services       Administration,         Rockville,        MD
[http://riskcommunication.samhsa.gov/index.htm.] for further information).

5.3. Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM). The deployed Wing/CC is
responsible to ensure that CISM services are available to deployed personnel by the
LSSC of the deployed Medical Group. CISM is an integrated system of interventions
designed to prevent and/or mitigate any adverse psychological reaction (i.e. post-
traumatic stress reactions). The goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to
cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended
to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanent
disability if possible. Moreover, the provision of these important services assists in
making a smooth transition back to the home base and in reinsertion in the family
constellation. See chapter 4 for further details.

5.4. After Action Reports. The deployed medical element (Expeditionary Medical
Support [EMEDS], SME, IDMT, etc.) must complete an after action report IAW AFI 41-
106 Medical Readiness Planning and Training, (Section 14.13.1) within 30 days of
completing a deployment or other operations (including some exercise/training
operations). Reports must be sent to the respective MAJCOM/SG and are meant to
capture the lessons learned for future operations.

5.5. Delayed Patient Identification. Casualties can appear days, weeks, months even
years after a deployment. These casualties may be the result of previously unidentified
hazards or be of unknown origin. Medical providers will evaluate such patients using the
tools and protocols of the (DOD) Post-Deployment Health Clinical Practice Guideline
(PDH CPG). This evaluation will be conducted by the presenting patient’s primary care
manager/team and should be documented using the PDH CPG diagnostic code. If a
communicable disease or deployment related illness is suspected, patients should be
referred to PH. PH will conduct an initial investigation. This investigation may include
an interview with the patient, and an epidemiological analysis.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                              38

                          INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

6.1. Overview. It is essential to be able to track and document illness and disease in
order to be proactive in preventing further spread and future outbreaks of disease. In
addition, a chronicle of exposures is necessary to assist in the detection and treatment of
future disease processes that may become chronic.

6.2.    Global Expeditionary Medical System.              Overall, GEMS improves the
documentation of delivered healthcare and response to health threats and/or CBRN
events that place our forces at risk. The GEMS reachback capability integrates patient
evaluation, epidemiological analysis, occupational/environmental exposures, and medical
command and control across the full spectrum of military medical operations and civil
support actions. GEMS improves, the documentation of the healthcare delivered and
response to threats and/or CBRN events that place our forces at risk. The by-products are
a better continuity of patient care, improved surveillance of the deployed forces' health,
and the direct reduction of illness and death through risk avoidance in the event of attack
or endemic event. The GEMS medical information system is a full spectrum medical
management system with the following system components:

Figure 6.1. The Global Expeditionary Medical System

GEMS is a suite of tools to provide Air Force-wide medical force protection through
standardized medical surveillance, analysis and Command and Control (C2). GEMS
components include:

 - Patient Encounter Module (PEM) provides a standard electronic medical record for
worldwide patient expeditionary surveillance and rearward connectivity.

 - Theater Epidemiology Module (TEM) aggregates field medical data, monitors
deployed troops for BW/epidemic events, and provides theater medical C2 capability.

 - Algorithms produce disease epidemiology reports as indicators of potential BW attack.
Personnel may modify these algorithms to meet local requirements.

 - A Theater Occupational Module (TOM) designed to monitor and track complex
endemic, environmental, occupational, and operational-related exposures in the deployed
setting.

 - Force-wide, command-level, data analysis of deployed medical occurrences is
archived at Brooks City Base, Texas, and USACHPMM.


6.3. Patient Encounter Module. The PEM is a paperless linked tool for front line
medics to record individual patient assessments. The system works from a handheld

device in mass casualty or combat environments. The information collected is
aggregated at progressively higher levels allowing for accurate theater assessment,
epidemiologic monitoring and decision-making from the local to theater level.

6.4. Theater Occupational Module. TOM does occupational and environmental health
surveillance and offers continuous monitoring of deployed individuals and locations for
area threats and condition. The users can conduct Environmental Health Site
Assessments, Potable Water evaluations, and Industrial Hygiene surveillance. The TOM
creates a concise data set for the GEMS theater database with an integrated force
protection capability.    Until an NBC module is developed and fielded, NBC
environmental surveillance data should be entered into the existing TOM as appropriate.

6.5. Data Reporting and Repository. USACHPPM maintains a central repository for
occupational and environmental health data. The GEMS system will be used to transmit
TOM information to the central repository. The information will be provided to the
AFFOR/SG as well as the AFIOH. AFIOH will analyze the data as described in interim
policy on occupational health surveillance published by AFMOA. In addition, any
survey reports should be provided to USACHPPM according to DOD, theater, and
AFFOR/SG procedures.

6.6. Public Health Deployed (PHD). PHD documents all public health related
information and exposures. These include: Medical Entomology, Food Facility
Inspections, Public Facility Inspections, Food Storage and Procurement Inspections, and
Ration Inspections.
6.7. Theater Epidemiological Module. The TEM uses the aggregated field patient data
from a single site or multiple sites. It provides both summary reports and graphic
representation of disease activity, rates and trends. The TEM generates the Disease Non-
Battle Injury Report (DNBI) as well as other surveillance and medical care documents. It
also tracks important command and control information including dispositions of ill and
injured patients, medical facility capability and PH concerns affecting the deployed
population. Using pre-defined disease and symptom complex information, the TEM acts
to automatically monitor and alarm if rates exceed pre-defined thresholds.

                             EDUCATION AND TRAINING


7.1. Introduction. The goal of education and training, formal or informal, is to impart a
working knowledge of concepts, principles, and procedures for casualty prevention
intervention. The education and training building blocks for Air Force medical service
personnel begins at initial training, upon entry into the service, and continues with
periodic refresher training throughout the lifecycle of the service member. The pieces of
the blocks can best be described in three phases: initial training, sustainment training,
and just-in-time training. (See Figure 7.1)

7.2. Initial Training. Initial training will occur at the accession/entry level course. For
the enlisted, these entry-level courses may include Basic Military Training at Lackland
AFB, the Expeditionary Medical Readiness Course (EMRC) at Sheppard AFB, or Basic
Expeditionary Medical Readiness Training at Brooks AFB. Officers receive initial
training by attending the Commissioned Officer Training/Reserve Commissioned Officer
Training course, or through a commissioning program such as a Service academy,
Reserve Officer Training Corps, or Officer Training School, and technical school at the
USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) at Brooks AFB.

7.3. Sustainment Training.

   7.3.1. Enlisted personnel enter into the sustainment training upon award of the 5-skill
   level. Officers enter sustainment training after completion of unit orientation
   program and being awarded a fully qualified Air Force specialty code (AFSC).

   7.3.2. AFSC sustainment training is designed to maintain medical skills of a fully
   qualified member to adequately perform the duties required by the member’s AFSC
   in a deployed setting. All personnel assigned to a UTC must participate in
   appropriate AFSC-specific training. The Readiness Skills Verification Program
   (RSVP) database is the source for AFSC specific sustainment training requirements.
   The Wartime Medical Planning System Office, www.warmedurl.af.mil, is the
   primary guide for medical specialty-specific readiness training.

   7.3.3. UTC sustainment training requirements are derived from the Mission Essential
   Task Lists that are established by the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging
   owner of the UTC. MAJCOMs may provide supplemental guidance for medical
   personnel to complete additional training based on readiness missions.

   7.3.4. Sustainment training can be formal in-resident training or utilize distance-
   learning capabilities, which are integral in reducing temporary duty costs and time
   away from home station.
AFTTP 3-42.2 20 April 2004                                                             41


7.4. Just-In-Time (JIT) Training. Although JIT training is a component of education
and training, it is not the optimal or desired method of training. Therefore, JIT training
should occur just prior to the deployment phase (pre-deployment) of the operation or
while deployed. Just-in-time training is specific to the deployed location and situation.
