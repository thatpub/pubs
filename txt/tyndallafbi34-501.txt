SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Items were changed due to Honor Guard quotas being updated (para 1.2.1), clarification of
individual responsibilities, and the addition of the Honor Guard decoration policy.
1. RESPONSIBILITIES
   1.1. Military funeral honors must be provided upon request for all deceased Air Force active
   duty, retired, and veterans in accordance with the following instructions:
2                                                TYNDALLAFBI34-501 25 OCTOBER 2012


               AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program
               AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Program
               AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel
               AFI 34-1201, Protocol
               AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies
    1.2. The installation commander oversees the program, enforces AFI 34-242, and determines
    the size of the Honor Guard. Installation location, population, and how often military and
    civil protocol activities occur determines manning requirements.
       1.2.1. Manning goals are determined by multiplying the authorized number of E-5s and
       below for each group by a fair share matrix calculation. The result will be rounded to
       the nearest whole number. Example: 500 (unit authorization) times 6.0% = 30, rounded
       up to the nearest whole number would be 30; or 490 times 5.0% = 24.5, rounded up to the
       nearest whole number would be 25. If the manning goals are not met, the number of
       details performed by the team could suffer. Funerals are the primary mission, so other
       details may be temporarily suspended. The manning goals will be updated annually or as
       necessary. See Attachment 2 for the list of group quotas.
    1.3. The Tyndall Honor Guard is managed by the 325 FSS/FSO for administrative and
    operational control. Honor Guard personnel will not be assigned to squadron or base details
    during their two weeks of Honor Guard duty time (i.e., security forces augmentee, bay
    orderly, etc.) and if possible, will not be assigned to night shift duty. Additionally, both
    professional and personal appointments will not be made during this time unless pre-
    approved by the Honor Guard NCOIC.
       1.3.1. Personnel should not be on a control roster or have a history of administrative or
       disciplinary action. Personnel must present a positive military image and conform to
       grooming standards IAW AFI 36-2903. Individuals on a physical profile limiting
       walking, marching, lifting, extended standing, or a shaving waiver are not eligible for
       Honor Guard duty. (Exception to shaving waiver: an individual who is able to shave
       before performing a detail will be permitted to apply.)
    1.4. For the duration of their contract, all Honor Guard members are entitled to have two
    duty uniforms per week and the ceremonial uniform cleaned free of charge by the base linen
    exchange. The ceremonial uniform may be dry cleaned by base linen exchange as often as
    necessary. The NCOIC will issue an authorization letter to the base linen exchange office
    naming personnel authorized this service. Once released from the Honor Guard, former
    members are no longer authorized free dry cleaning through base linen exchange.
    1.5. If a member receives three unexcused no-shows for practices, strong consideration will
    be given for dismissal from the team. The same applies for one unexcused no-show for a
    function. The NCOIC of the Honor Guard will make the determination if a no-show is
    excused.
    1.6. Weapons used by the Honor Guard will be stored in the base Honor Guard armory (M-
    1) and the SFS armory (M-14) and will be issued to qualified Honor Guard personnel only.
    A current authorization letter will be kept in the SFS armory. Proper cleaning and
    maintenance of the weapons will be the responsibility of Honor Guard personnel. The 325
TYNDALLAFBI34-501 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                             3


  SFS/CATM will inspect the weapons annually. Each member required to handle a weapon
  will receive proper training from Honor Guard trainers.
  1.7. Providing military funeral honors is the primary mission of the base Honor Guard
  program. Upon request, a funeral honors detail is provided for all eligible members. The
  Honor Guard will support ceremonial functions on a case by case basis; time and resources
  permitting. The ceremonies should be affiliated with military heritage. The military funeral
  honors mission takes precedence over ceremonial functions. The wishes of the family
  regarding the honors elements that are provided are paramount.
  1.8. Ceremonial functions are prioritized in the following order: wing, group, unit,
  community, and by request date. On base requests will be limited to Change of Commands
  and/or annual awards banquets. No individual promotion ceremonies will be performed.
  Units will utilize their own members to perform ceremonies to the utmost extent possible.
  Training for these events is available, but will be scheduled through the NCOIC.
  1.9. The Honor Guard will only present the colors at retirement ceremonies for members in
  the grade of E-8 and above and O-4 and above. This change establishes a standard for all
  retirements and greatly increases the flexibility of manning the Honor Guard utilizes to
  perform funeral details.

TYNDALLAFBI34-501 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                           5


     2.5.1. Ensure members are released to attend all scheduled practices and functions.
     Supervisors should make every effort to de-conflict work center requirements during
     their subordinates’ assigned week.
     2.5.2. Give a 24-hour notice to the Honor Guard NCOIC, if a member must miss a
     function or practice. (NOTE: Supervisors must inform the First Sergeant of their
     decision to excuse a member from a function.)
        2.5.2.1. Adhere to and understand that assigned weeks are mandatory and Honor
        Guard members MUST be released to the Honor Guard. Supervisors’ inability to
        release their subordinates to Honor Guard for assigned weeks due to mission demands
        must be justified to their First Sergeant, who will coordinate the release through the
        Honor Guard NCOIC.
        2.5.2.2. Adhere to and understand that if members continuously fail to be available
        for Honor Guard duty during their assigned week, excluding leave, TDY, medical
        release, or other uncontrollable events, the unit will be required to provide a
        replacement that will begin a new 13-month commitment.
     2.5.3. Ensure members are not tasked additional duty hours (i.e., overtime) to make up
     for Honor Guard commitments during duty hours.
     2.5.4. Consider compensatory time off for individuals working after duty hours or long
     weekends.
  2.6. Honor Guard members will:
     2.6.1. Have a complete understanding of when they are assigned to the Honor Guard and
     when they are off-duty. The member will be ultimately responsible for notifying his
     supervisor and his unit of this schedule. This allows for a projection of duty and leave
     schedules within the unit.
     2.6.2. Attend all scheduled practices and functions.
     2.6.3. Possess required military clothing and will exceed standards IAW AFI 36-2903,
     Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
     2.6.4. Be physically and mentally qualified to handle firearms safely and be capable of

     2.6.6. Maintain a high level of military bearing and project a professional image at all
     times.
     2.6.7. Have unquestionable integrity, loyalty, trustworthiness, and dependability.
     Adverse disciplinary action will be grounds for removal from the Honor Guard at the
     discretion of the NCOIC.
     2.6.8. Individuals assigned to the Honor Guard should have upgrade training complete,
     but this is not a requirement. If a member is in upgrade training he/she will be given
     study time while detailed to the Honor Guard. If the member is failing upgrade training,
     the member will be immediately removed from the Honor Guard and the squadron will
6                                                   TYNDALLAFBI34-501 25 OCTOBER 2012


       coordinate the replacement of the individual. The replacement will be assigned for 13
       months.
       2.6.9. Honor Guard members must notify the NCOIC of any absence that will affect their
       two- week rotation. Leave must be projected at least 14 days prior to a members’
       scheduled rotation. The NCOIC reserves the right to disapprove leave when the manning
       on an individual flight falls below acceptable levels or when the ability to perform
       funerals will be lost. Leave during an individual’s rotation will be approved on a case by
       case basis. It will have to be requested through the individual’s supervisor. The NCOIC
       may approve leave for member’s while on rotation.
3. The 325 MSG/LRDTO
    3.1. Assign air-conditioned vehicles in top mechanical condition and appearance for
    transportation of the Honor Guard.
    3.2. The Honor Guard has one full-time 15 passenger van. If additional vehicles are
    required to perform details, the 325 MSG/LRDTO will exhaust every effort to ensure
    transportation is provided.
    3.3. The Honor Guard will ensure all drivers are fully qualified before operating a
    government vehicle.
4. FLIGHT NCOs
    4.1. Appointment of this position should be an NCO or a SrA who has graduated ALS with
    at least 6 months Honor Guard experience.
    4.2. Flight NCOs are accountable for their flights during training, recalls, and daily
    activities. They are the flight members’ primary POC for all primary concerns.
    4.3. Flight NCOs will also work closely with the NCOIC and a scheduler to ensure current
    information on leave, TDY, and absences of subordinate Honor Guard members are up to
    date.
    4.4. Flight NCOs will also be responsible for nominating a member for the Quarterly/Annual
    awards and writing the nominee’s package.
5. HONOR GUARD TRAINERS
    5.1. The trainer’s mission is to produce and maintain continuity in the performance of
    ceremonies. Duties will include maintenance of training records for all members,
    certification of flight trainers, attendance at weekly refresher sessions, and initial training of
    new members.
    5.2. The tour of duty will be, at a minimum, one day per quarter for each flight and one full
    week a quarter for initial member training sessions. The head trainer is not excluded from
    Honor Guard recognition, and is eligible for an annual decoration.
6. TOUR OF DUTY
    6.1. The Unit Commander/First Sergeant will personally interview every volunteer and their
    supervisors with the final decision made by the Honor Guard NCOIC.
TYNDALLAFBI34-501 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                                7


  6.2. Each member is required to remain on the Tyndall AFB Honor Guard for a minimum of
  13 months, with a minimum of one rotation each month. A member’s release will not be
  final until a replacement from his/her unit has been trained and is in place. Leaves, TDYs, or
  deployments encountered during a member’s rotation are not counted in the member’s 13-
  month tour of duty and must be made up.
     6.2.1. The member’s Honor Guard commitment begins when the member started the first
     rotation. The commitment does not start when the contract is signed.
     6.2.2. Members who extend their commitment beyond 13 months are not subject to the
     addition of time on their new contract for leaves, TDYs, or deployments extending past
     30 days. Extended contract members must comply with all sections of this instruction
     with the exception of the initial training section.
     6.2.3. In the event of a TDY that precludes the member from serving his full term, term
     of service will be extended equal to the time the member was TDY (i.e. if a member is
     TDY for three months, the term of service will be extended three months).
     6.2.4. In the event of a PCS or hardship that precludes the member from serving the full
     term, the respective squadron commander will replace the member (30 days in advance to
     allow for proper training and orientation).
7. INITIAL TRAINING
  7.1. Initial training for all new members should consist of a 5-day training program. This
  training will consist of classroom instruction, drill, and evaluation covering all aspects of the
  Honor Guard duties to include wear of the ceremonial uniform. This training can be
  conducted on the member’s scheduled rotation or in a quarterly training flight as necessary.
  7.2. After initial training, the new member will be evaluated on his/her performance. At this
  time, a decision will be made to determine if the individual will become a full-time member,
  require additional training, or be released from the team. All attempts will be made by the
  NCOIC to ensure each member is retained.
8. DUTY SCHEDULE
  8.1. The Honor Guard team consists of four flights: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. Each
  should consist of 9-10 members. See Attachment 3 for group quotas.
  8.2. Each flight will rotate weekly, one week on duty, the following week on call, and two
  weeks off. Members will report directly to the Honor Guard building for the entire week
  they are on duty.
  8.3. Duty hours are 0700 – 1600, Monday – Friday, and on call Saturday and Sunday.
  8.4. Duty schedules will be provided quarterly to each member. The member is responsible
  for notifying his supervisor of his Honor Guard duty schedule.
9. EXCUSED FROM DUTY
  9.1. The member’s immediate supervisor must excuse individuals that are unable to attend
  any Honor Guard detail or practice for any reason. (Note: Supervisors must first inform the
  First Sergeant of their decision to excuse a member from a practice or function and the First
  Sergeant will make the final decision.)
8                                                 TYNDALLAFBI34-501 25 OCTOBER 2012


10. ON-CALL FLIGHT
    10.1. The on-call flight will be utilized for the following reasons, (1) to provide for two or
    more funeral requests with conflicting dates and times, (2) to fulfill an active duty funeral,
    and (3) to support the on call flight if manning goes below the minimum requirement.
    10.2. During the on-call week, Honor Guard members are required to remain in the local
    area unless on leave or TDY.
11. INSPECTIONS
    11.1. Open ranks inspection will be conducted on the flight coming on duty each week by
    the Flight NCO.
12. UNIFORMS
    12.1. Honor Guard ceremonial items listed in AFI 36-2903, paragraph 9.4, will be purchased
    using 325th Force Support Squadron O&M funds.
    12.2. Each member is responsible for maintaining his/her uniform in serviceable condition.
    Lost or damaged uniform items will be replaced at the member's expense. Members are
    required to return all issued equipment when their tour of duty has expired.
13. RECOGNITION PROGRAM
    13.1. Ceremonial Guardsman of the Year: The member who epitomizes the ideal guardsman
    based on duty performance, attitude, uniform inspections, professionalism, selflessness, and
    the ability to function as part of a cohesive team. The NCOIC will select the annual award
    nominee and submit his/her package to the 325 FW.
       13.1.1. Ceremonial Guardsman of the Quarter: The flight sergeants will nominate one
       member from each of the four flights. The package only board will consist of an AF
       Form 1206 with a maximum of 10 lines.
    13.2. The NCOIC will compile the scores and the name of the winner submitted to the wing
    where it will be announced at the wing’s Quarterly/Annual Awards ceremony.
    13.3. Decoration Policy for Honor Guard members:
       13.3.1. Honor Guard members will only be eligible for a decoration after they have been
       an active Ceremonial Guardsman for a full contract and have (1) performed a minimum
       of 25 details, (2) have maintained a Satisfactory fitness score per AFI36-2905, (3) been
       recommended for decoration by the NCOIC, and (4) the NCOIC recommendation has
       been concurred by the 325 FSS/CC. Standard PIF review shall also apply.
TYNDALLAFBI34-501 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                            9


     13.3.2. The NCOIC will evaluate all members who meet the minimum criteria for award
     of a decoration. Twenty-five details is a realistic goal, however, failing to achieve that
     number will not necessarily prevent a member from receiving a decoration. A decoration
     will be submitted, when in the judgment of the NCOIC, a member is deserving of
     recognition for sustained superior performance. Subsequent awards will be evaluated no
     more than annually.

MEMORANDUM FOR 325 FSS/FSOXH                                  Date: _______________________

FROM: ________________(Squadron) Commander/First Sergeant

SUBJECT: Tyndall AFB Honor Guard Selectee

Request I be allowed to serve on the Tyndall AFB Honor Guard. I understand that I am required
to be available to attend all details and practices during my duty week. If I cannot attend a detail
or practice, I will have my immediate supervisor contact the Honor Guard NCOIC at 283-4405.
An unexcused missed detail or practice will result in a "no-show" letter being sent to my
Commander/First Sergeant. I am required to return all equipment and uniform items issued to me
in a clean and serviceable condition. I fully understand that if selected as a member, I will serve a
13-month minimum tour. I also understand that anytime I am TDY, unavailable, or otherwise
unable to perform Honor Guard duties for an extended period, that time will be added to my
commitment. I understand I must give a 30-day notice of resignation upon my decision to
terminate my service to the Honor Guard and that this notice must be endorsed by my First
Sergeant and commander before it will be accepted by the Honor Guard NCOIC. I have read and
understand my responsibilities as outlined in TYNDALLAFBI 34-501.

and practices as required during his/her scheduled rotation and standby week. I further
understand that I may excuse the member from a detail or practice, but that I must inform the

coordinate his release. I have read and understand my responsibilities as outlined in
