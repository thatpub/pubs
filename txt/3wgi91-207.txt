      days from the date of the letter. Reports with open discrepancies must include an
      estimated completion date and must be updated every 30 days until each discrepancy is
      closed. If the (30 day) period is insufficient, request an extension by phone at DSN 317-
      907-552-4681. All requests are reviewed by SEW and the Chief of Safety will grant final
      approval. All requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
      3.2.3. Spot Inspections. These are inspections that are conducted by unit safety
      personnel or the Weapons Safety Office on a "no-notice basis." These inspections are
      documented on the spot inspection log. Spot inspections are an in-house tool for the
      ADWSR to instill day-to-day safety precautions. Observe people handling, transporting,
      maintaining, operating, or storing explosives and missiles. This should comprise the bulk
      of the spot inspection program.
      3.2.4. Unit Quarterly Safety Inspection:
          3.2.4.1. Conduct using one or all of the applicable weapons safety checklists.

          further guidance.
   5.3. Unserviceable Explosive Items:
       5.3.1. Unserviceable explosive items are those that are no longer authorized for use.
       These items may become unserviceable due to many factors, such as suspended lots,
       expired shelf/ service life, damage beyond TO limits, and so forth.
       5.3.2. Unserviceable explosive items CANNOT be stored with serviceable items. Put
       them in a separate facility or physically segregate them from serviceable items in the
       same location (normal lot-to-lot separation is not considered segregated).
       5.3.3. Unserviceable explosive items must be conspicuously marked. The markings will
       be clear to prevent inadvertent issuing, loss of information, and show exact status of the
       item.
       5.3.4. Dangerously unserviceable items require immediate attention. If items cannot be
       destroyed immediately, they should be isolated from other facilities by inter-magazine
       distance. When such items are discovered, notify the appropriate agencies (that is,
       explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), SFS, Fire Department, and the Weapons Safety
       Office).
       5.3.5. Turn unserviceable explosive items in to the Munitions Storage Area within 7
       days.
6. Publicity:
   6.1. General. The publicity program is in reality a part of the safety education process;
   however, the dissemination process is different. There are many ways with which you can
   disseminate safety information.
   6.2. Crosstell. Crosstell reports are mishap reports from other units with the same or similar
   weapons system. These are actual mishap reports that are received by 3 WG/SEW, sanitized
   for distribution, and sent to you via base information transfer center (BITC), e-mail, or fax.
   This information needs to be briefed throughout your unit. Placing a copy on your unit’s
   weapons safety bulletin board is also a means of getting the word out. Ensure to post a copy
   in your management book for future use during Safety Day briefings.
   6.3. Weapons Safety Newsletter. The 3rd Wing Weapons Safety Newsletter is an excellent
   way to get information to your sections.
