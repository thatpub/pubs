This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements, by providing guidance and
procedures supervisors need to schedule civilian employees (except non-US citizen employees employed
outside the United States and the District of Columbia) for work and holiday observances. It tells how to
establish work schedules, rest and lunch periods, make ready and clean-up time. It describes work subject
to premium pay and shows how to get approval for holiday work.

MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement (AWA) programs. MAJ-
COMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation commanders (para 3.3.). Organization
and tenant commanders establish by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the
basic 40-hour tour of duty, including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours
and location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their
respective organizations (para 3.2.). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2., 4.3., and 4.4.
which had previously been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a sample
AWA agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).
The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.
(AFRC) This supplement is significantly revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
incorporates policy guidance from various memorandums on the duty status of ARTs. Paragraph 2.14.2.
(Added) Establishes requirement for the use of the AFRC Timecard. Paragraph 4.4.3.2. (Added) modi-
fies AFRC time and attendance policy regarding the authorization of a 20 minute on-the-job lunch period
for aircrew members during long distance flights. Paragraph 4.7. (Added) through 4.7.3. (Added) modi-
fies guidance for crew rest requirements. Paragraph 4.10. (Added) trough 4.10.6. (Added) modifies the
duty status of ARTs.

1. Scope of Applicability. This instruction applies Air Force-wide, to appropriated fund civilian employ-
ees, including US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard Title 5, United States Code.

2. Terms and Definitions. The following terms and definitions are used in this instruction.
    2.1. Administrative Workweek. The Air Force administrative workweek begins at 0001 Sunday and
    ends at 2400 on the next following Saturday. The calendar day on which a shift begins is considered
    the day of duty for that day even though the day of duty extends into the next calendar day or into the
    following administrative workweek.
    2.2. Alternative Work Schedules (AWS). Work schedules made up of flexible or compressed sched-
    ules.
    2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement, either
    at home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See Attachment 2 for a sam-
    ple agreement).
    2.4. Basic Workweek. The days and hours of an administrative workweek which make up a full-time
    employee's regularly scheduled 40-hour workweek.
    2.5. Compressed Schedule. Compressed schedule means for a full-time employee, an 80-hour
    biweekly basic work requirement which is scheduled in less than 10 workdays. In the case of a
    part-time employee, it is a biweekly basic work requirement of less than 80 hours which is scheduled
    for less than 10 workdays.
    2.6. First 40-Hours. The first 40 hours of duty performed within a period of no more than six days of
    the administrative workweek may be established as the basic workweek when it is impractical to pre-
    scribe a regular schedule of definite hours of duty each workday.
    2.7. Flexible Schedule. Flexible schedule is that portion of the work day during which the employee
    has the option to select and vary starting and stopping times within established limits set by installa-
    tion level approving officials for AWS.
AFI36-807_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        3


   2.8. Holiday Work. Work performed on a legal holiday or the day observed as a holiday.
   2.9. Observed Day. Observed day is a holiday in which employees are given time off on a day other
   than the date which the holiday actually falls on.
   2.10. Part Time. In some circumstances it is not possible to obtain or use an employee's services for
   the full 40-hour workweek. Part time tours of duty may be authorized when service on a regular,
   repetitive basis is required at least one day during each administrative workweek, however, additional
   service may be required during the remainder of the administrative workweek.
   2.11. Regular Tour of Duty. The regular tour of duty for Air Force employees is five 8-hour days,
   Monday through Friday.
   2.12. Special Tour of Duty for Educational Purposes. A special tour of duty of no less than 40 hours
   in an administrative workweek which may be established by supervisors to permit employees to take
   courses at nearby educational institutions.
   2.13. Standby. Certain types of work require employees to remain at their duty stations for long peri-
   ods of duty, a substantial part of which is standby time. For example, the tour of duty for firefighters
   generally is a 72-hour workweek of three 24-hour days. The tour is scheduled so that the employee is
   on duty three alternate 24-hour shifts during each administrative workweek, and deviations from this
   tour are kept to a minimum. The basic weekly tour of duty for fire chiefs, assistant fire chiefs, fire pre-
   vention inspectors, and similar fire protection personnel is 40-hour workweek of five 8-hour days
   unless the duties of the position require substantial amounts of standby time.
   2.14. Uncommon Tour of Duty. Any 40-hour basic workweek scheduled to include Saturday and or
   Sunday, for four workdays or less but not more than six days of the administrative workweek. An
   uncommon tour of duty may be established when necessary for efficient operations or when the cost
   of operations can thus be reduced without imposing undue hardship on employees.
       2.14.1. (Added-AFRC) Non dual status technicians (NDST), formally known as status quo
       employees are normally assigned to an uncommon tour of duty to provide coverage during unit
       training assemblies (UTA).
       2.14.2. (Added-AFRC) All tour of duties will be documented on AFRC Automated Timecard.
       The automated timecard will be provide by HQ AFRC/A1CE

3. Basic Authority:
   3.1. Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders establish the hours for opening and closing
   the installation.
   3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish by writ-
   ten order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty including
   uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative
   workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective organizations.
   Organization and tenant commanders or their designated representative should set work schedules,
   assign overtime and holiday work to balance mission requirements, efficiency and economy of opera-
   tions, and employee needs. These determinations are subject to approval by the installation com-
   mander or his or her designated representative who has authority for operation of base facilities.
   NOTE: organization/tenant commanders set the hours and locations for AWS and AWA; MAJ-
4                                                    AFI36-807_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2007


    COMs/FOAs/DRUs approve AWS and AWA programs, unless they delegate this authority to instal-
    lation commanders as provided in 3.3.
       3.2.1. Organization and tenant commanders may also establish regularly scheduled tours of duty
       of more than 40 hours within the administrative workweek when such action is essential to mis-
       sion accomplishment, and when other administrative action such as changes in authorized staffing
       or detail of personnel is neither feasible or desirable. Except under extraordinary circumstances, a
       tour of duty which includes regular overtime should not extend beyond 48 hours in an administra-
       tive workweek. Organization and tenant commanders may extend the regularly scheduled admin-
       istrative workweek to any length exceeding 40 hours when emergency conditions exist and it is
       necessary for mission accomplishment. The extension of the tour of duty will be subject to the
       requirements of applicable laws and regulations.
    3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major Commands
    (MAJCOM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are authorized to
    approve AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to instal-
    lation commanders
    3.4. Supervisors. Supervisors will generally schedule employee's work on the same hours each day,
    and breaks in excess of one hour during a day will not be permitted. Supervisors must give a mini-
    mum of one week's notice to employees when they are to be assigned to a different tour of duty or to
    different hours of duty except as provided under AWS or for educational purposes.
       3.4.1. Commanders may grant an exception to this requirement when circumstances preclude
       compliance, for example, when a change in shifts by a contractor requires immediate correspond-
       ing change in the tour of inspectors, or when normal operations are interrupted by events beyond
       the control of management, such as, fire, flood, breakdown of equipment. Commanders assure
       that changes in established work schedules are kept to a minimum and made only when necessary
       to resolve operational problems.

4. Tours of Duty:
    4.1. Tours of Duty for Educational Purposes. Supervisors may establish special tours of duty for edu-
    cational purposes.
       4.1.1. Employees who are on special tours of duty for educational purposes cannot be paid pre-
       mium pay solely because the rescheduling of his or her tour of duty causes him or her to work on
       a day, or during the hours of a day, when premium pay would otherwise be required.
       4.1.2. Supervisors are not prohibited from assigning an employee to a regularly scheduled shift
       requiring premium pay, for example, night pay, since no additional costs are incurred. Supervi-
       sors must notify the civilian payroll office when an employee is assigned to or changed from a
       special tour of duty to prevent inadvertent payment of premium pay. Supervisors must maintain a
       record of these tours of duty for the purpose of responding to Office of Personnel Management
       (OPM) inquiries.
    4.2. Posting Work Schedules. Supervisors must post copies of work schedules for all tours of duty,
    except regular Monday through Friday tours, which include the names of assigned employees in the
    work area. Supervisors must maintain a copy of employee's work schedules in their operating office.
    Supervisors:
AFI36-807_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     5


     4.2.1. Post a written statement of actual work requirements for standby tours of duty.
     4.2.2. Give employees with regularly scheduled 60 or 72 hour standby tours of duty 30 calendar
     days notice of any reduction in the percentage of premium pay resulting from a change in work
     requirements.
     4.2.3. Give employees with regularly scheduled 40-hour tours of duty plus scheduled standby
     time as much notice as possible when changing their duty schedule.
     4.2.4. Review work requirements periodically for changes which may affect the payment of pre-
     mium compensation and revise work schedules where necessary.
     4.2.5. (Added-AFRC) The requirement that a 1 week's notice be given before a change in tour of
     duty is waived under the circumstances listed below. Notify employees of such changes as far in
     advance as possible. In any situation, notify the employee before reporting for duty on the day of
     the proposed change. Use of this authority is limited to that necessary for essential operations as
     determined by appropriate authority.
         4.2.5.1. (Added-AFRC) For aircrew personnel on missions of more than 1 day's duration, to
         include the day of departure from home station.
         4.2.5.2. (Added-AFRC) For aircrew members and ground support personnel to meet special
         or other essential unscheduled flying missions.
         4.2.5.3. (Added-AFRC) For aircrew members and specialized and ground support personnel
         performing weather reconnaissance or rescue missions.
  4.3. Scheduling Rest Periods. Supervisors may schedule short rest periods, not exceeding 15 minutes
  during each four hours of continuous work, when the supervisor believes the rest periods will be of
  benefit to the service. (NOTE: Supervisors must adhere to applicable labor management agreements
  if they contain provisions for the granting of rest periods.)
     4.3.1. Criteria to be followed by supervisors in determining the justification for granting rest peri-
     ods are:
         4.3.1.1. Protection of employee's health by relieving them from hazardous work or very phys-
         ical work.
         4.3.1.2. Reduce the accident rate by removing the fatigue potential.
         4.3.1.3. Relieve those who work in confined spaces.
         4.3.1.4. Increasing or maintaining a high quality or quantity production.
  4.4. Scheduling Lunch Periods. When supervisors schedule lunch (or other meal) periods, during
  which the employee is entirely free of the duties of his or her position, the period is not considered as
  duty time for which compensation is paid.
     4.4.1. Supervisors will generally schedule time for lunch apart from the hours of duty when one
     or two shifts are in operation.
     4.4.2. When supervisors schedule more than one 8-hour shift in a 24-hour period and an overlap-
     ping of shifts to permit time off for lunch is not possible, supervisors may authorize an on-the-job
     lunch period of 20 minutes or less. On-the-job lunch periods require that:
6                                                     AFI36-807_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2007


           4.4.2.1. Employees spend their on-the-job lunch at or near their work stations. Under these
           conditions, the time covered by the 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is compensable.
           4.4.2.2. Employees given duty free lunch periods during periods of overtime work will not
           receive compensation for that time.
       4.4.3. (Added-AFRC) When lunch is consumed during a long distance flight, an on-the-job
       lunch not to exceed 20 minutes may be authorized if time to take a meal break on the ground is not
       possible.
           4.4.3.1. (Added-AFRC) A 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is also authorized for aircrew
           members for any long duration flight regardless of the distance flown or the need for an over-
           night stay at another location. Long duration flights are defined as those flights performed in
           civilian status where the flight briefing, flight time, and post mission duties equal or exceed
           80% of the aircrew member’s regularly scheduled civilian duty day. This places the employee
           well beyond the midday timeframe when the lunch brake is taken.
           4.4.3.2. (Added-AFRC) A 20 minute on-the-job lunch period is also authorized for aircrew
           members for any long duration flight regardless of the distance flown or the need for an over-
           night stay at another location. Long duration flights are defined as those flights performed in
           civilian status where the flight briefing, flight time, and post mission duties equal or exceed
           80% of the aircrew member’s regularly scheduled civilian duty day. This places the employee
           well beyond the midday timeframe when the lunch brake is taken.
    4.5. Scheduling Make Ready and Clean-Up Time. Incidental duties that are directly connected with
    the performance of a job, such as obtaining and replacing working tools or materials, undergoing
    inspections, and similar tasks are considered part of the job requirements within the employee's estab-
    lished tour of duty. Supervisors must arrange work shifts so that time required for incidental duties
    will be part of the 8-hour day.
       4.5.1. When incidental duties cannot be part of the regularly scheduled workday, the extra time
       for which overtime may be paid to an employee, will not exceed 30 minutes a day.
    4.6. (Added-AFRC) Long Distance Flights. Tours of duty and attendance reporting for aircrew
    members on long distance flights are as follows:
       4.6.1. (Added-AFRC) A long distance flight is defined as a situation where an aircrew member
       departs his or her home station, arrives at another duty station and remains overnight at the remote
       duty station.
       4.6.2. (Added-AFRC) The tour of duty and daily hours of work for ART aircrew members
       engaged in long distance flights is governed by and charged to the directed reporting for duty time
       each day. The ART aircrew members' work begins at the directed reporting time for preflight/pre-
       planning duties based on the proposed takeoff time and ends upon completion of postflight duties
       and excusal from duty.
       4.6.3. (Added-AFRC) To avoid confusion in time and attendance reporting, record duty dates
       and times on a 24-hour basis in the hours of the home station time zone. Ignore date changes that
       occur by crossing the International Date Line.
    4.7. (Added-AFRC) Crew Rest Requirements. Tours of duty and attendance reporting for aircrew
    members with crew rest requirements are as follows:
AFI36-807_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                      7


     4.7.1. (Added-AFRC) Aircrew members must comply with flight duty periods and crew rest
     periods as required. To the maximum extent possible, civilian aircrew duty days should be sched-
     uled/adjusted to coincide with the flying schedule. When situations arise and aircrews are required
     to remain in crew rest past their scheduled workday reporting time or enter crew rest during the
     civilian workday, the following options apply:
     4.7.2. (Added-AFRC) If the flight/flight duty for which the employee is in a crew rest status will
     be performed in civilian status, then no leave is to be charged.
     4.7.3. (Added-AFRC) If the flight/flight duty for which the employee is in a crew rest status will
     be performed in military status, then the employee will either take appropriate leave such as
     annual leave, LWOP-US, accrued compensatory time off, or accrued credit hours, or adjust his/
     her duty day to accommodate the crew rest requirement.
  4.8. (Added-AFRC) Constructive Credit. When temporary duty (TDY) on a scheduled workday and
  through no fault of the employee, an employee starts work but less than 8 hours of work are per-
  formed, the employee is credited with 8 hours total duty. (EXAMPLE: Employee reports as directed at
  0600, takes off at 0800, lands at 1200, performs post flight duties, and is excused at 1300; that individ-
  ual is credited with 7 hours of work and 1 hour of constructive credit.) Regardless of the reason and
  irrespective of whether within the employee's control, if employees do not report for work they are
  placed in the appropriate leave category or have their workweek rescheduled. Constructive credit
  hours may not be granted if there is no work to be performed at the TDY location and it is known prior
  to the start of the employee's civilian workday. In addition, constructive credit hours may not be
  granted at home station.
  4.9. (Added-AFRC) AFRC flying units maintain time and attendance records on the AFRC Form 4,
  Air Reserve Technician (Aircrew) Work Hours Report (CIV, AD, IAD). All aircrew members com-
  plete this form during TDYs involving flying duties where conversions to and from military status
  occur. The aircraft commander reviews and certifies this form and turns in to the individual's time-
  keeper upon completion of the mission.
  4.10. (Added-AFRC) Duty Status for Air Reserve Technicians.
     4.10.1. (Added-AFRC) ARTs may perform duty either at home station or away from home sta-
     tion in either military or civilian status except as stated below:
         4.10.1.1. (Added-AFRC) Attendance at formal schools: IAW AFMAN 36-8001.
         4.10.1.2. (Added-AFRC) Exercises: Active duty; however, unit commanders may authorize
         civilian status for exercises at home station that do not involve other Air Force or AFRC units
         or other military components.
         4.10.1.3. (Added-AFRC) Airborne support or directed mission: Active duty outside CONUS
         unless the unit commander determines civilian status is authorized.
         4.10.1.4. (Added-AFRC) Flights into hostile area flights or imminent danger zones: Active
         duty.
     4.10.2. (Added-AFRC) Travel in civilian status solely to perform military duty is forbidden and
     vice versa. However, travel in civilian status to perform civilian duty in conjunction with IDT or
     active duty is acceptable.

    4.10.3. (Added-AFRC) Changes in Duty Status. Except as provided below, the duty status in
    which ARTs depart home station will continue until they return. All periods of military duty must
    be scheduled in advance, meet normal reserve participation requirements, and be annotated on
    official orders. Changes in duty status must be approved by the supervisor.
       4.10.3.1. (Added-AFRC) If one or more inactive duty for training (IDT) periods are sched-
       uled while away from home station the employee will convert to IDT and back at times speci-
       fied on the scheduling documents. If periods of civilian duty are scheduled in conjunction with
       IDT flight training; ensure that all preflight and/or postflight duties are performed in IDT sta-
       tus. An IDT period may be completed on the same day that civilian duty is performed.
       4.10.3.2. (Added-AFRC) If one or more active duty periods are scheduled while away from
       home station, all conversions from civilian to active duty or from active duty to civilian status
       will occur at times specified on the scheduling documents.
       4.10.3.3. (Added-AFRC) TDY orders are completed according to current guidance. In addi-
       tion, a remark must be included to annotate each conversion to active duty or civilian status
       IAW with the applicable order number. For example, Member will convert to active duty sta-
       tus at 0800 on 12 September IAW RO D-245. A remark must also be included to indicate
       when IDT is authorized in conjunction with civilian TDY which identifies the dates and times
       of conversion. For example, “Member will convert to IDT status on 12 September at 0800,
       revert to civilian status at 1700 on 12 September, convert to IDT status at 0800 on 13 Septem-
       ber, and convert to civilian status at 1700 on 13 September.”
    4.10.4. (Added-AFRC) Exceptions to the above policies will be requested through command
    channels to AFRC/CV/CVA for consideration.
    4.10.5. (Added-AFRC) Duty Status Overseas. Before sending ARTs overseas in civilian status,
    Commanders will ensure ARTs are briefed on legal ramifications, requirements, and proper immi-
    gration procedures for all countries that might be transited. ARTs may be in civilian status in all
    foreign areas that are not designated “active duty only by AFRC/CV or the Wing Commander or
    as hostile fire/imminent danger areas by the Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force or AMC/
    TACC. ARTS may convert from civilian to active duty status while in transatlantic or transpacific
    flights at 0001 hours local. Current rules for conversion to and from military status still apply.
       4.10.5.1. (Added-AFRC) ARTs will convert to active duty status at 0001 hours local on the
       calendar day of departure from the last ground location prior to entering the foreign area des-
       ignated as hostile fire/imminent danger/active duty only. Local time means the time at the last
       ground location prior to departure into the hostile fire/imminent danger/active duty only zone.
       ARTs will remain on active duty status until all of the following conditions are met: The active
       duty mission is terminated and on the ground; the individual is outside the hostile fire/immi-
       nent danger/active duty only designated foreign area; and the time is 2400 hours based on the
       time zone in which the active duty began.
    4.10.6. (Added-AFRC) Duty Status While Engaged in Training. The duty status of ARTs while
    engaged in training is dependent upon the relationship of the training to the civilian position. If the
    training is solely related to the military requirements of the employee’s reserve assignment and is
    not considered to be part of the civilian duties, the employee must be in an appropriate leave status
    to attend that training during the civilian workday. Small arms training and chemical defense

      training (more commonly known as chemical warfare training) are two training situations that best
      represent this scenario.

5. Holiday Observances:
   5.1. Holiday Duty. Supervisors must not require employees to work on holidays or days designated
   as observed days, unless the work is justified by unusual circumstances or if the maintenance of usual
   essential services is involved.
      5.1.1. Supervisors will order holiday work when required and have it approved in writing by an
      official designated to authorize holiday work. Supervisors must obtain this approval before work
      is performed, except in cases of an emergency, because it constitutes authority for expenditure of
      funds and certification that funds are available to pay the employee. Supervisors ordering work on
      a holiday or employees required to remain on duty during an emergency will not require advance
      approval for the work. Supervisors must record the reasons for the holiday and the hours worked
      by the employees no later than the following workday. This requirement does not apply to tours
      of duty regularly scheduled on a holiday or observed day for employees engaged in essential ser-
      vices such as firefighters, police, hospital employees, or other service personnel. The supervisor
      will record holiday work on an AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and
      Compensatory Time.
   5.2. Observed Day. When a holiday falls on a regularly scheduled workday, observe that day as the
   holiday. If a holiday falls on Sunday and the employee has a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic work-
   week of Monday through Friday, the employee will observe the following Monday as the holiday.
   When the holiday falls on Saturday, the employee will observe the holiday on the proceeding Friday.
      5.2.1. When a holiday falls on a Sunday and that Sunday is a nonworkday for employees with a
      regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek of other than Monday through Friday, observe the
      next regularly scheduled workday as the holiday.
          5.2.1.1. When a holiday falls on the nonworkday designated as the day in-lieu-of Sunday,
          observe the next regularly scheduled workday as a holiday. When a holiday or a designated
          observed day falls on an employee's nonworkday (Monday through Saturday), the workday
          immediately preceding the day is observed as the holiday.
      5.2.2. Deleted
   5.3. Deleted
   5.4. When full-time employees on a compressed work schedule are relieved or prevented from work-
   ing on a day designated as a holiday, they are entitled to basic pay for the number of hours of the com-
   pressed work schedule on that day.
   5.5. Holiday observances for employees who work a flexible schedule are the same as those for
   full-time employees with a regularly scheduled 40-hour basic workweek.
   5.6. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee's regularly scheduled workday, the employee is
   entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is scheduled to work on the actual
   day of the holiday.
10                                                     AFI36-807_AFRCSUP_I 14 NOVEMBER 2007


        5.6.1. If full-time employees observe an "in-lieu-of" day instead of the actual holiday and that
        "in-lieu-of" day falls within a part-time employee's work schedule, the part-time employee will
        not get that day off with pay.
        5.6.2. When a holiday is observed by full-time employees on a day within the part-time
        employee's regularly scheduled workweek and the part-time employee is prevented from working
        that day, the employee is entitled to be excused with pay for the number of hours he or she is
        scheduled to work on that day.
        5.6.3. When a holiday falls on a part-time employee's nonworkday and is observed by full-time
        employees that day, the employee is not entitled to the holiday.
        5.6.4. When a part-time employee is on a flexible schedule and is relieved or prevented from
        working on a day designated as a holiday by a Federal statute or Executive Order (E.O.), the
        employee is entitled to receive basic pay for the number of hours the employee would have
        worked on that holiday up to eight hours.
        5.6.5. When a holiday falls on a nonworkday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu of" day
        for that holiday.
        5.6.6. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and is relieved or prevented
        from working on a day within the employee's scheduled tour of duty that is designated as a holiday
        by Federal statute or E.O., the employee is entitled to basic pay for the number of hours of the
        compressed work schedule on that day.
        5.6.7. When a part-time employee is on a compressed work schedule and a holiday falls on a non-
        workday, the employee is not entitled to an "in-lieu-of" day for that holiday.
     5.7. Duration of Holiday. The full 24-hours of a calendar day are normally considered as the duration
     of a holiday. However, when an employee's regular workday begins on a holiday and extends into the
     next calendar day, the entire shift is considered as a holiday to determine the employee's entitlement
     to holiday premium pay or time off for observance of the holiday. If an employee's regularly sched-
     uled tour of duty includes two shifts beginning on a holiday, the first shift is considered as a holiday
     to determine holiday benefits.

                     ALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTS (AWA)

A2.1. REASONS FOR AWA. Employers offer alternative workplace arrangements for many reasons.
Such arrangements may:
     A2.1.1. Improve the quality of work life and job performance and increases productivity, e.g., reduce
     office overcrowding and provide a distraction-free environment for reading, analyzing and writing;
     A2.1.2. Improve morale and reduces stress by giving employees more options to balance work and
     family demands;
     A2.1.3. Increase customer access to needed services;
     A2.1.4. Provide services when the regular office is closed;
     A2.1.5. Extend employment opportunities to people with disabilities, including employees who have
     partially recovered from work-related injuries who can do the job from an off-site location;
     A2.1.6. Accommodate employees who have temporary or continuing health problems or who might
     otherwise have to retire on disability;
     A2.1.7. Potentially enhance recruitment and promote diversity by expanding the geographic recruit-
     ment pool; and
     A2.1.8. Decrease traffic and parking congestion, energy consumption and air pollution.

A2.2. Organizations planning to use AWA should address issues such as the following: work assign-
ment/performance requirements, time and attendance, work schedule and tour of duty, duty station, leave,
equipment/supplies, labor relations issues, and other related work arrangement requirements.

A2.3. Sample Agreement Between Organization, Supervisor, And Employee Approved For An
Alternative Workplace Arrangement On A Continuing Basis:
        The supervisor and employee should each keep a copy of the agreement for reference.

        Other Action. Nothing in this agreement precludes the organization from taking any appropriate
disciplinary or adverse action against an employee who fails to comply with the provisions of this agree-
ment.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates IC 99-1 and adds the definition of alternative workplace arrangement (AWA)
as paragraph 2.3., (re-numbering the remaining terms and definitions in paragraph 2..), and authorizes
MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs to establish alternative workplace arrangement (AWA) programs. MAJ-
COMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation commanders (para 3.3.). Organization
and tenant commanders establish by written order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the
basic 40-hour tour of duty, including uncommon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours
and location(s) for alternative workplace arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their
respective organizations (para 3.2.). IC 99-1 assigns numbers to material in paragraphs 4.2., 4.3., and 4.4.
which had previously been listed with bullets, and adds Attachment 2, with information and a sample
AWA agreement for supervisors and employees. Changed or revised material is indicated by a bar (|).
The entire text of IC 99-1 is at Attachment 3.
2.3. Alternative Workplace Arrangements (AWA). Working under a flexiplace arrangement, either at
home or other approved location(s), such as a telecommuting center (See Attachment 2 for a sample
agreement).
3.2. Organization and Tenant Commanders. Organization and tenant commanders establish by written
order the daily hours for beginning and ending work and the basic 40-hour tour of duty including uncom-
mon tours of duty, alternative work schedules (AWS), hours and location(s) for alternative workplace
arrangements (AWA), as well as rest and lunch periods for their respective organizations. Organization
and tenant commanders or their designated representative should set work schedules, assign overtime and
holiday work to balance mission requirements, efficiency and economy of operations, and employee
needs. These determinations are subject to approval by the installation commander or his or her desig-
nated representative who has authority for operation of base facilities. NOTE: organization/tenant com-
manders set the hours and locations for AWS and AWA; MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs approve AWS and
AWA programs, unless they delegate this authority to installation commanders as provided in 3.3.
3.3. Major Commands, Field Operating Activities and Direct Reporting Units. Major Commands (MAJ-
COM), field operating activities (FOA) and Direct Reporting Units (DRU) are authorized to approve
AWS and AWA programs. MAJCOMs, FOAs or DRUs may delegate this authority to installation com-
manders.

dent or injury that occurs at the alternative workplace and to complete any required forms. The supervisor
agrees to investigate such a report immediately.
        Work Assignments/Performance. Work requirements are developed as a joint effort between

according to guidelines and standards in the employee’s performance plan. The employee agrees to pro-
vide regular reports if required by the supervisor to help judge performance. The employee understands
that a decline in performance may be grounds for canceling the alternative workplace arrangement.
