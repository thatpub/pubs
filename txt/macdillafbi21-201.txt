approximately 100 feet inside the gate in the parking area specified by 6 SFS. Vehicles
transporting explosives will be escorted to Thunder Village/South Ramp Access Road, Suspect
Vehicle Holding Area/Inspection Area (see Attachment 2) by 6 SFS. 6 SFS will notify 6 LRS,
Cargo Movements Element (DSN 968-1800/2800, Commercial 813-828-1800/2800). 6 LRS,
Cargo Movement Element, will notify Maintenance Production Superintendent (DSN 968-
9210/9211, Commercial 813-828-9210/9211) and Munitions flight (DSN 968-1765/1763,
Commercial 813-828-1765/1763, normal duty hours) that a shipment has arrived and is awaiting
inspection. Carrier must remain with vehicle at all times during this period until the next duty

        3.3.2. Upon arrival at inspection site, Transportation Inspector will inspect vehicle
        including opening trailer to inspect blocking and bracing for adequacy. Inspector will
        prepare necessary forms and give driver a copy of DD Form 626. If there is any evidence
        of damage in shipment, emergency procedures will be followed (see Attachment 5). A
        Munitions Inspector (2W051/71/91) will be called to survey damage, determine cause for
        deficiencies, and state whether explosives may proceed safely to unloading area.
        Appropriate reports will then be initiated. Anytime sabotage is suspected, additional
        Security Forces will secure the area. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (DSN 968-
        4406/3635, Commercial 813-828-4406/3635) and Air Force Office of Special

     loading site. Driver will be escorted at all times while within the MSA and must be present
     while loading operations are being completed.
     4.5. When loaded, the vehicle will not be moved until blocking and bracing have been
     accomplished by Packing and Crating personnel, and the Transportation Inspector has
     inspected and released vehicle to driver. 6 LRS personnel will be escorted in the MSA.
     4.6. Transportation Inspector will apply seals (paragraph 2.2.3.), record identification
     numbers, and verify bill of lading for explosive shipments going by commercial vehicle.
     Driver will be provided a completed/signed DD Form 626. Cargo Movements Element will
     provide escort for HC/D 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 explosive laden vehicle(s) leaving MSA.
