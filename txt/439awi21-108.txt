SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises 439AWI21-108 by updating shop codes and equipment listings.
Updates have also been made throughout the instruction that corrects incident response
expectations as well as who requests special equipment. This interim change also adds
attachments 4, 5 ,6, 7 and 8.
1. Overview. The CDDAR Team must be prepared to respond to aircraft incidents for
Westover ARB and surrounding areas. Primary considerations of the CDDAR team are to open
the runway for operational use, to prevent secondary damage to disabled/incident aircraft and to
preserve evidence for accident/mishap investigation.
2. Procedures/ Responsibilities.
     2.1. The Incident Commander (IC) as determined by the 439 AW CEMP Plan 10-2 is the
     person in charge at the incident until all emergency response actions are completed. Transfer
     of command to recovery organizations to include the CDDAR Team Chief takes place when
     hazard mitigation is complete. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) under the EOC
     Director develops a recovery plan, which is approved by the Installation Commander before
     it is implemented. The EOC Director assures expedient, cooperative responses to CDDAR
     situations by MXG, personnel, fire protection and other essential agencies.
     2.2. All base organizations involved in crash recovery must be familiar with the 439 AW
     CEMP Plan 10-2 and the 439 AW Mishap Response Plan 91-204. The responsibilities of
     each essential base organization for CDDAR response are as follows:

        accident/incident sites. The IC is the only point of contact at the accident/incident site.
        When the area is safe/secured, the IC responsibilities will be turned over to the CDDAR
        Team Chief.
        2.2.2. Security Forces Squadron (SFS) will report and coordinate with the IC to
        implement responsibilities to control the vicinity of the mishap site.
        2.2.3. Civil Engineering Environmental Management (CEV) will advise the Emergency
        Operations Center (EOC) of hazardous material handling procedures. The CDDAR Team
        will assist the hazardous material response team members with clean-up, recovery and
        disposal procedures for all hazardous materials.
        2.2.4. Base Bioenvironmental Engineering (SGPB) will advise the EOC Director of the
        type(s) of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required to perform recovery of an
        aircraft containing composite/hazardous materials. In consultation with the CDDAR team
        chief will perform annual survey of CDDAR responsibilities and duties, and recommend
        appropriate PPE to be available to eliminate possible health hazards. SGPB will be
        available during crash recovery operation to advise on required occupational health
