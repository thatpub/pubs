                                                                         Distribution: See attachment 3.

This instruction implements AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning, and the 25 November 1986 Memorandum
of Agreement between the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; and the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA). It describes the responsibilities of personnel who manage, prepare, publish, distribute,
and use JTCG/ME publications. It directs functional management for the publication of Joint Munitions
Effectiveness Manuals (JMEM) and JTCG/ME Special Reports produced by the Joint Technical Coordi-
nating Group for Munitions Effectiveness.



1. Developing JTCG/ME Publications. Department of Defense (DoD) Components (Army, Navy, Air
Force, Marine Corps, and DIA) collaborate to develop and publish JTCG/ME documents. The Joint
Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and DoD Components use these documents to plan and analyze attack missions,
develop weapon requirements, and conduct wargaming exercises. The JTCG/ME operates according to
the Joint Logistics Commanders (JLC) decisions and directions. JTCG/ME publishes all material accord-
ing to the JTCG/ME Publication Information Guide, 61JTCG/ME 1-3.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. JTCG Steering Committee. The Army Materiel Command, Naval Ordnance Center, Air Force
   Materiel Command, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Marine Corps appoint staff-level representa-
   tives to the JTCG/ME Steering Committee as Principal Service Members. The Steering Committee:
       2.1.1. Directs Working Group studies, tests, meetings, other required activities, and funding.
       2.1.2. Establishes working groups to meet the needs of the tri-service operational commands and
       other users of nonnuclear munitions data.
   2.1.3. Coordinates technical data among Services, approves data for use in JTCG/ME publica-
   tions and establishes priorities.
   2.1.4. Provides technical guidance to subgroups and approves publication of data generated by
   the subgroups.
   2.1.5. Prepares budgets and distributes funding for publishing all JTCG/ME publications.
   2.1.6. Develops, reviews, and coordinates the technical content of JTCG/ME publications,
   including changes and revisions.
   2.1.7. Establishes procedures for controlling the distribution of publications to agencies including
   non-DoD activities.
   2.1.8. Maintains security classification guidelines for publications.
2.2. Principal Service Members:
   2.2.1. Respond to requests for publication information.
   2.2.2. Coordinate JTCG/ME publication matters within their own Services and agencies to ensure
   they approve technical content and promptly authenticate JMEMs.
   2.2.3. Develop initial distribution lists for new JMEMs and an updated list for each JMEM
   change or revision.
2.3. Air Force:
   2.3.1. Provides the JTCG/ME Publications Management Office at Tinker AFB, OK. This office
   manages the publication, distribution, and sanitization of JTCG/ME documents.
       2.3.1.1. Sanitization is the process of removing data from the JTCG-ME products and publi-
       cations prior to release to customers or countries. The Publications Management Office will
       screen products and publications to blank out, remove, or omit all data not authorized or not
       needed by a particular customer.
       2.3.1.2. HQ AFMC/DRW controls distribution of JTCG-ME products and publications
       within DoD. Forward requests by DoD organizations or associated contractors for JTCG/ME
       publications to JTCG/ME PUBLICATIONS, OC-ALC/TILUB, 7851 2ND STREET SUITE
       206, TINKER AFB OK 73145-9160.
       2.3.1.3. Since many JTCG/ME publications are classified or not releasable to specific agen-
       cies, DoD organizations or associated contractors must accompany their requests for these
       publications by verified security clearance and facility storage authorization. Contractors also
       must obtain approval from their contract monitor. For foreign government requests refer to
       paragraph 2.5.
       2.3.1.4. DoD program offices, laboratories, field activities, and associated contractors should
       submit requests for JTCG/ME publications in writing to the above address according to para-
       graph 2.3.1.3. Additional distribution instructions are in Part I of the Joint Service Index of
       Specialized Technical Handbooks, 61JTCG/ME 1-2.
   2.3.2. Manages JTCG/ME numbered documents program.
   2.3.3. Serves as the government contracting agency for the JTCG/ME General Support Contrac-
   tor.

       cerns impacting the quality or timely distribution of JMEM publications and special reports
       with recommendations for resolution. The Air Force will brief the current status of allocated
       funding.
2.4. DoD Components:
   2.4.1. Each DoD component determines how it identifies, numbers, and internally manages cop-
   ies.
   2.4.2. Participating DoD components designate offices (listed at attachment 1) to receive corre-
   spondence, authenticate JMEMs, recommend changes, and conduct other matters that relate to
   JTCG/ME publications.

appropriate channels to the JTCG/ME publication Manager, OC-ALC/TILUB, 7851 2nd Street, Suite
