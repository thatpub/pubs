        profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept any present, emolu-
               ment, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state."

    if so, the nature and projected amount of that compensation.

    government would be inadvisable or reflect unfavorably on the United States.
    3.4. A statement explaining whether foreign citizenship is required or planned.
    3.5. A statement declaring that the member will not be required to execute an oath of allegiance to the
    foreign government.
    3.6. A statement declaring that the member understands that retired pay equivalent to the amount
    received from the foreign government may be withheld if he or she accepts employment with a for-
    eign government before receiving approval.
