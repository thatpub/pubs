     part and provide it to the requesting organization. If the supply representative is not on the
     ground in Thailand then the using organization will follow the procedures provided on the
     outside of the cage or contact Delta Golf, 730 AMS, or JPAC personnel on the ground at U-
     Tapao for access procedures.
        3.1.1. If an asset is being pulled by maintenance personnel from the 374 AW, they must

     spreadsheet by annotating the date, time, base (if other than Yokota), and person to whom the

     can update the R21 or locally developed spreadsheet.
     3.3. The 374 AMXS Supply representative will transport DIFM back to Yokota AB if an
     asset is pulled to repair an aircraft. If no aircraft is available for immediate transport, then

     DIFM will be returned to APS as soon as transport is available.

   Maintenance Issue (MSI) from the kit with TEX Code W. The DIFM will then be routed to
   the appropriate back-shop for repair if available. If no back-shop support is available then
   the APS will immediately process a turn-in with the applicable condition and action taken
   code to expeditiously return the unserviceable asset to the appropriate agency.
   3.5. All parts issued to replenish the CHPMSK will be stored in a designated holding area
   within the APS until the next scheduled rotation.
   3.6. Routine (XD, XF and XB3) requirements to replenish the CHPMSK will be transported
   through rotating aircraft accompanied by a supply representative. The APS will sign over
   accountability of all assets to be replenished to the supply representative who will then be
   responsible for replenishing the kit in Thailand.
   3.7. The LRS APS will coordinate with Headquarters Pacific Air Forces Weapon Systems
   Support Section (HQ PACAF/A4RMW) on all recommended CHPMSK add, change or

   3.8. The APS is responsible for processing all transactions necessary to maintain and
   replenish the CHPMSK.
4. Inventory Procedures:
   4.1. A supply representative will go TDY monthly to ensure movement of repairable assets,
   validate security measures, and conduct a complete inventory of the kit. During these
   rotations the supply representative will accomplish the transfer of repairable and other assets
   to and from U-Tapao. A supervisory review should be accomplished by a SNCO or above
   from the 374 LRS and the 374 AMXS bi-annually.
      4.1.1. Upon arrival in U-Tapao, the supply representative will take all replenishment
      assets to CHPMSK storage area. A 100% inventory will be conducted using the R21; if a
      current R21 is not available, APS will be allowed to use a Discoverer Plus/Viewer report
      as an option to the R21. The individual conducting the inventory will sign the R21
      listing, to take responsibility for validating accountability and security of assets contained
      in the CHPMSK.
   4.2. The supply representative may use all 3 copies of the R21 or Discoverer Plus/Viewer
   listing to annotate any transactions that may have occurred during the rotation.
      4.2.1. Upon return from deployment the APS will file the annotated and signed copy of
      the R21 or Discoverer listing and keep it on file for one year.
      4.2.2. The transportation of replenishment/returned repairable assets not placed on
      rotation aircraft due to urgent mission requirements will be coordinated between 374
      AMXS and APS.
      4.2.3. The following items will be held for 374 AMXS rotation aircraft: hazardous
      materials and assets requiring draining or purging.

        4.2.4. An asset stock position, local repair capability, size and weight will help determine
        the mode of transportation.
        4.2.5. If the supply representative is unavailable to complete their monthly visit to
        Thailand and replenishment action is required, they will work with the 374 AMXS so
        they can transport and complete the kit replenishment. The APS will sign over
        accountability of all assets to be replenished to the 374 AMXS who will then be
        responsible for replenishing the kit.
5. Lateral Support Procedures:
     5.1. Any serviceable assets returning from U-Tapao as lateral support for Yokota AB will be
     processed by APS.
        5.1.1. APS will process the ISU request to establish a due-out, if one is not already
        established in the system, followed by a special requisition to establish a due-in. Then
        they will process the receipt; once the DOR document is output, they will coordinate with
        maintenance so they can sign the necessary paperwork.
     5.2. All other lateral support requests will be coordinated through the 635th/735th Global
     Logistics Support Center weapon system managers located at Scott or Langley AFB.
     Standard procedures identified in AFMAN23-110, USAF Supply Manual, will be followed
     for all lateral support requests.
     5.3. Normal DIFM procedures will apply.
6. Asset Security:
     6.1. Due to the type of parts being stored in the kit, it is highly recommended that all assets
     be stored in a secured area that can be monitored on a day-to-day basis by US Government
     personnel on the ground in Thailand.
     6.2. The Air Mobility Command or Delta Golf personnel located in U-Tapao Thailand
     provide security over the cage that houses the CHPMSK; only personnel that are on the
     approved 374 LRS/AMXS roster/listing will be allowed access to the cage. A combination
     lock will be used to secure the cage area and all ISU-90 containers that are storing aircraft
     parts. Additionally the combinations to all locks will be changed by the supply
     representative semiannually, or more frequently as deemed necessary by the 374 LRS/CC.
        6.2.1. If an asset is needed to support transient non-374 AW aircraft, the Air Mobility
        Command or Delta Golf personnel will immediately make contact with 374 LRS aircraft
        parts store personnel via DSN: 225-8484/8110/9907, commercial number (00981) 3117-
        55-8484, or standby cell phone 090-6195-5299 for one time approval to access the kit.
            6.2.1.1. If contact cannot be made with APS, then Air Mobility Command or Delta
            Golf personnel will make contact with 374 MXG Maintenance Operations Center
            (MOC) at DSN: 225-2582 or (00981) 3117-55-2582, who will in turn make contact
            with the 374 LRS APS or 374 AMXS/MXASUR for approval to access the
            CHPMSK.
     6.3. The APS or 374 AMXS supply representative will give non 374 AW transient personnel
     specific guidance over the phone about the correct procedures to remove an asset from the
     kit, and how to secure the kit after the asset has been removed.
374AWI23-202 22 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                              5


  6.4. The supply representative will be responsible for securing the cage after replenishment
  actions have been completed. If a supply representative is not present then the Air Mobility
